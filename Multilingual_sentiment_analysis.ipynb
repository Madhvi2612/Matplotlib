I asked the owners how they keep their prices so reasonable and they said it's because they work with farmers that don't sell at the local farmer's markets, but want to sell their produce nonetheless. What they can't get locally (due to season or unavailability) they have from other states. They also carry home-made tortillas, kettle corn, honey, and salsas- all local!

Secondly, and most importantly, they have the most amazing selection of LOCALLY grown produce! Oh my god, it makes me so happy I'm probably going to cry. I asked the owners how they keep their prices so reasonable and they said it's because they work with farmers that don't sell at the local farmer's markets, but want to sell their produce nonetheless. What they can't get locally (due to season or unavailability) they have from other states. They also carry home-made tortillas, kettle corn, honey, and salsas- all local! I absolutely love this place. If you can't get to the Farmer's Markets or live too far (like me) you have to check this place out!\n",
            "Original: Over the summer months, this stand-alone farmer's market doesn't carry as much locally grown produce, especially at the end of the summer like July-Sept. Nearly everything they carry is from elsewhere due to the high heat of AZ I'm sure. That's fine with me but unfortunately that means veggies and fruit from other parts of the country that aren't as fresh. I've gotten some bad produce but the good part is I can just take it back and get a refund. I do think though that next summer during this time I'll be going to one of the various weekly farmer's markets or just to Sprouts for produce. Every other time I'll still be here. :)\n",

Of course it's a little tricky to do here in the heat of the summer, but the Power Road market manages to stay stocked year around with produce that is fresh and for the most part local. It's a small Mom-n-Pop market, but they work with local retailers around the valley to bring in all sorts of different foods that go way beyond produce. They also roast fresh chilies daily, & sell locally made tamales and salsa too. The prices are what really get me. So many complain about the jacked-up prices of farmer's markets, but this place has always been either the same in price, or I pay even less. Plus, because most of it is local, the food lasts longer! If you're in the east valley, they are worth checking out and changing where you buy your produce. Buy local whenever you can!\n",

And, most importantly, my customers were happy.

But the chevre is my first and best love from Crow's Dairy, and whenever I need chevre, I try to make a trip to the farmer's market rather than buy it from a store, as the store-bought stuff is never as fresh and tasty.\n",

            "Original: As a long time lover of great cheeses, and especially feta, there is no place better to get your cheese from than Crow's Dairy.I have tried almost all of the different kinds they make and I think the worst part is picking which one to buy.  The regular feta and the peppercorn feta are two of my must-haves.  The peppercorn gives a nice little kick thats great paired with tomatoes and cucumbers.  Also, the chevres are creamy and so delicious.  If you are looking for more of a sweet treat from your cheese, definitely try the butter pecan.  It tastes like a delicious cheesecake and I could literally eat an entire container by itself in one sitting (thank God for self-control, right)I would say that worst thing about Crow's Dairy cheese is that I have to wait until the weekend Farmer's Market to get it!\n",

Please bear with me because this experience is being recalled from over a year ago-I just thought I'd Yelp about it because it is the reason I keep going back to this store! About twelve people from our club RSVP'd and showed up for the event.  We had a private wine tasting class in the back room-Intro to Wine Tasting or something like that.  Bob was very friendly and unpretentious which is important because some people like to be Wine Snobs which is a total turn-off. He started off talking about various kinds of glassware and how it affects flavor of the wine-demonstrating this to us with a sparkling wine in two different glasses. We journeyed from sparkling white wine all the way through the reds and ended with a dessert wine.  We also got to try some amazing cheeses and meats, and olives that were to DIE for (lucques, I believe).  In the end we received a discount on our purchases from the evening (EVERYTHING WE TASTED!) and I also bought some international treats from the shelf.

They also save your purchase history so you can buy the same or similar wines when you come back.

            "Original: The Benedum Center for the Performing Arts was originally a movie theater called The Stanley. It was built in 1927 and was billed as \"Pittsburgh's Palace of Amusement.\" It's acoustics are nearly perfect because back when it was built, 65 cents would not only buy you a \"photoplay\", but you'd also get live entertainment too. A two year renovation in the late 1980s under the guidelines of the U.S. Department of the Interior brought it back to its original condition. The grand lobby's mirrors and woodwork are all original. Of the more than 90 chandeliers and sconces in the theater, only one is a replica. In fact, the main chandelier weighs 4,700 pounds and is 20 feet high and 12 feet wide. The sightlines here are awesome. It truly is a masterpiece of theater design. Let's face it fellow Yelpers, you're not here for my architectural reviews are you Okay. I came here last night for the Decemberists concert featuring Justin Townes Earle as the opener. There were only single seats left when I tried to get tickets. So I ended up going by myself to the show. Hey a married babe can treat herself to a night out on occasion! The Portland, OR based Decemberists have been burning up the indie rock scene for a few years now and their CD \"The King Is Dead\" has been doing quite well. So much so that it reached 1 on the Billboard Charts in late January. The Decemberists in the past have dabbled in so-called \"progressive rock\" and British folk but this new CD is definitely more of an AmericanaAlt Country sound. So much so that the single \"Down by the Water\" reminds me of Firetown's \"The Good Life\" for some reason (Firetown later evolved into Garbage--in both senses of the word.. But that's another story). So it was no surprise that after doing \"The Crane Wife, Parts 1-3\", Colin Meloy told the audience \"I don't know who wrote the set list, but they thought we were a prog band. We're not a prog band anymore. We're a folk band.\" Hmmm! That actually was a pretty apt description. Despite this, they managed to get a lot of songs in from their catalogue. There was plenty of good singin' and good playin' though. Sam Watkins of Nickel Creek played fiddle against Jenny Conlee's accordion and they did a rousing Irish jig to the song \"Rox in the Box\". It was almost strange though how Meloy apologized for taking the tempo down a notch during the gorgeous new song \"Rise to Me\". They also did their most epic pieces in the middle of the show, and face it folks, you can't keep a good prog band down! But anyway, this show proved that the Decemberists aren't some flash in the pan. Their many musical stylings and their abililty to move a show along proves that they're in it for the long haul. I should also mention that my 60-something father, a music fan in his own right, absolutely loves the Decemberists. Now you know where I get those genes from. As I mentioned, Justin Townes Earle opened the show and if his last name sounds familiar, it should. His father is the iconic Steve Earle (another one of my favorites). Justin gets his middle name Townes, from Townes Van Zandt, of whom Steve Earle was a great friend. Justin Townes Earle is definitely more bluesy than his old man and while he seems to be a good performer, only time will tell if he lives up to the musical legacy of his father.\n",

            "Translated: The Benedum Center for the Performing Arts was originally a movie theater called The Stanley. It was built in 1927 and was billed as \"Pittsburgh's Palace of Amusement.\" It's acoustics are nearly perfect because back when it was built, 65 cents would not only buy you a \"photoplay\", but you'd also get live entertainment too. A two year renovation in the late 1980s under the guidelines of the U.S. Department of the Interior brought it back to its original condition. The grand lobby's mirrors and woodwork are all original. Of the more than 90 chandeliers and sconces in the theater, only one is a replica. In fact, the main chandelier weighs 4,700 pounds and is 20 feet high and 12 feet wide. The sightlines here are awesome. It truly is a masterpiece of theater design. Let's face it fellow Yelpers, you're not here for my architectural reviews are you Okay. I came here last night for the Decemberists concert featuring Justin Townes Earle as the opener. There were only single seats left when I tried to get tickets. So I ended up going by myself to the show. Hey a married babe can treat herself to a night out on occasion! The Portland, OR based Decemberists have been burning up the indie rock scene for a few years now and their CD \"The King Is Dead\" has been doing quite well. So much so that it reached 1 on the Billboard Charts in late January. The Decemberists in the past have dabbled in so-called \"progressive rock\" and British folk but this new CD is definitely more of an AmericanaAlt Country sound. So much so that the single \"Down by the Water\" reminds me of Firetown's \"The Good Life\" for some reason (Firetown later evolved into Garbage--in both senses of the word.. But that's another story). So it was no surprise that after doing \"The Crane Wife, Parts 1-3\", Colin Meloy told the audience \"I don't know who wrote the set list, but they thought we were a prog band. We're not a prog band anymore. We're a folk band.\" Hmmm! That actually was a pretty apt description. Despite this, they managed to get a lot of songs in from their catalogue. There was plenty of good singin' and good playin' though. Sam Watkins of Nickel Creek played fiddle against Jenny Conlee's accordion and they did a rousing Irish jig to the song \"Rox in the Box\". It was almost strange though how Meloy apologized for taking the tempo down a notch during the gorgeous new song \"Rise to Me\". They also did their most epic pieces in the middle of the show, and face it folks, you can't keep a good prog band down! But anyway, this show proved that the Decemberists aren't some flash in the pan. Their many musical stylings and their abililty to move a show along proves that they're in it for the long haul.

Here are a couple interesting facts:  The mirrors, marble and woodwork in the Grand Lobby are all original.  There are over 90 crystal chandeliers, torchieres and sconces in the theater, all but one are original.  The original cost was $3 million back in 1928.  Compare that to the 1987 restoration that cost $43 million.  We had perfect seats, Row AA.  How lucky is that  Loved the performance.  My first time for Wicked.  But just as entertaining is the view of theater.  Love it here.  So beautiful and so ornate.  And while the seats are showing some signs of wear, the good news is the 2,881 seats will be repaired and refurbished to the tune of $450,000.You know, it always feels really special here.

            "Original: I love it here! It is like walking into a little piece of history, I could see the upper crusts socializing in here back in the day. Furs and fedoras, and those long cigarette holders gracing the hallways. This is a gorgeous theater its hard to capture it with pictures because of lighting glares. I have not experienced large playhouses in other cities. But my advice is pick a show you love a decent Broadway one, splurge once a year it will make your experience that much more memorable. Spend a little extra for refreshments yes they are expensive but again the experience. I don't think the upper seats are bad but some on yelp seem to, if it is what you can afford it is still a nice view. And unlike Heinz hall you have a little leg room. There are always a few audience members behaving naughty that was my only complaint. The ushers are helpful and will let you in if you are few minutes late (Grrr that Pittsburgh parking), speaking of parking I would park at the 9th and Penn garage or the one on liberty and ninth if you can. I appreciate this theater for its history and modern contributions, I think some individuals do not understand that this kind of history in other American cities has been left to decay. Cue in Detroit, sadly. So props to cultural trust or whomever for keeping this one going.... true Pittsburgh beauty,\n",

            "Original: Most Charlotteans don't realize that we have such a fabulous ballet company in residence here in our fair city. It is led by Artistic director Jean Pierre Bonnefoux and his wife Patricia McBride who are world renowned for dancing in the New York City Ballet under George Balanchine. What does that mean for non dance connoisseurs It means young dancers want to come to NCDT from all over the world (literally) to dance under their tutelage which translates to a better experience for patrons.NCDT has always has a great reputation for modern contemporary ballets, but they also excel at classic, storybook ballets like Romeo & Juliet, and funny children's ballets like Cinderella. But their sweet spot (and why they attracted resident choreographer Dwight Rhoden who you may have seen on So You Think You Can Dance) is the innovative contemporary works. In fact their annual Innovative Works in late fall often sells out. It features several short pieces that often have a theme or message.  My favorite piece, Satto, was featured again recently in Director's Choice was originally an Innovative Work. Another one they debuted this year had two male artists partnering with Anna Gerberich and never let her feet touch the ground the whole time. The artists and choreographers ebb and flow but you're always going to see a great show with a wide variety of styles. You may not like every single piece, but at least they're conversation pieces. Similarly, you're not going to love every painting in the Mint. It's worth seeing something other than Nutcracker, so dive in, the water's fine.If I have any complaint, it's that every dancer has a different stylestrength and Jean Pierre seems to have favorite principals that he sometimes over casts. Kind of like John Fox.I grew up watching such dance companies as the SF ballet, Bolshoi, Joffrey Ballet, ODC, Alvin Ailey and the CincinnatiSan Jose ballets so this ain't my first rodeo.Ladies, one more selling point in two words: eye candy. Glistening, muscular athletic men often dancing shirtless. I'm just saying. Sue me.\n",

After the performance an opera Q&A session was held for anyone wishing to stay.

It is a an accomplished company with a splendid school attached.The first thing I can say is when most regional companies have gotten smaller, Ballet AZ keeps growing. Ib Anderson, the Artistic Director, danced with Balanchine in New York.  He will not do a ballet that he doesn't know he his company can do and do well.  In watching his him work, I feel he has the ability to make everyone in the company feel what they have to offer is of great value from the newest member to the principal dancers.  There is less \"attitude\" in this company than I have ever seen.  The dancers are hard workers who want as good as what Ib asks of them and that is a great deal.  The people you don't see such as the people who do the costumes and the sets  do a remarkable job of making things happen that sometimes start as nothing more as idea of Ib's.When I first started working with this group, i was surprised when I heard people say this and that was as good as they'd seen all over the world.  I am not surprised now.  Ballet AZ has brought together dancers from all over the world due to it's excellent reputation. These professionals have come to take advantage of working in an organization that is striving for something better each production than the one before.   If in some areas, Phoenix has  long way to go in catching up in the arts, the Ballet is not one of them.  We have a fine company here in AZ that continues to excel in presenting varied productions that range from the classics to world premieres.Prices are quite reasonable for what is offered.  There are different packages that make it even more attractive with special prices on certain dates.  Contact the box office abut that.  Another way to see the shows is to join the volunteer organization.  We work hard but the end result is the pleasure of knowing we help make a beautiful thing like Ballet AZ blossom and grow.\n",

I am not surprised now.  Ballet AZ has brought together dancers from all over the world due to it's excellent reputation. These professionals have come to take advantage of working in an organization that is striving for something better each production than the one before.   If in some areas, Phoenix has  long way to go in catching up in the arts, the Ballet is not one of them.  We have a fine company here in AZ that continues to excel in presenting varied productions that range from the classics to world premieres.Prices are quite reasonable for what is offered.  There are different packages that make it even more attractive with special prices on certain dates.  Contact the box office abut that.  Another way to see the shows is to join the volunteer organization.  We work hard but the end result is the pleasure of knowing we help make a beautiful thing like Ballet AZ blossom and grow.\n",
            "Original: This review is for the current production ending 4509, Masters of Movement.Wow. What a great program.  They led w the classic Les Sylphides, but it was the 2 modern pieces that blew my socks off.  Polyphonia choreographed by Christopher Wheeldon had some incredible movements of balance and dexeterity that I turned to my sis, who was attending with me, and commented, \"I bet you and the Irish Hubbie do that in the bedroom.\" The final piece was The Golden Section from the Twyla Tharp ballet The Catherine Wheel. Twyla Tharp collaborates with David Byrne (Talking Heads) = FUUUUNNNN. The energy of that number with the dancers flying and the beat of Byrne's music made that piece my favorite.David Byrne ROCKS.\n",

            "Original: We really enjoy Ballet Arizona productions. We recently saw The Nutcracker - an annual family tradition. They make a few modifications to the program every year. I really liked the tweaks this year. We also happened to attend a showing where Astrit Zejinati and Chelsea Wilcox doing the pas de deux. They were absolutely amazing. Our 5 year old has also been taking ballet lessons at the school there since she was 3.  We think the school is wonderful. They teach classical ballet vocabulary from 3 years old on. They are pretty strict and have a set curriculum. They all wear the same uniform and hairstyle and are strict about it. After the 3 year old class, parent's aren't allowed to watch other than one class per session where they let us all in. So far, from what we've seen though, the curriculum and the teachers are great. They do a lot to improve body control, teach musicality and start them on a course of classical ballet.We're big fans.\n",

            "Original: I received a pair of free tickets through Yelp to see The Nutcracker last Fri. evening.  I was very excited to see this show, since I'd wanted to see it last last year, but couldn't work it out with my (now ex-) boyfriend's schedule.  I'm used to second tier seating at the Benedum, but I was in for a real treat, since the tickets turned out to be for orchestra level (score!).  What a great surprise for my birthday, which happened to be that day!I really enjoyed PBT's performance of The Nutcracker!  Between the dancing, the choreography, and the costumes and scenery, I thought the show was excellent.  I've never seen a live performance of The Nutcracker before, and the last time I saw the movie was in elementary school music class.  Even though it'd been this long, I was able to follow the plot with very few problems.  I enjoyed the Pittsburgh-specific references in PBT's version of the show, which included a setting at a mansion in Shadyside and a Heinz carriage.I thought both acts were very good, and each had advantages.  The first act was easier to follow in terms of the plot, but I enjoyed the dancing better in the second act, which featured more of the principals and soloists.  Although the stage could get a bit crowded during certain scenes, the scenes were ones where it was either appropriate in light of the plot (e.g., the party scene in the first act) or where it was difficult to avoid (the final scene of the dream sequence).  In general, I found the visual impact of the show very pleasing--if you prefer more visually-oriented shows, as my friend who accompanied me does, this show would definitely be your cup of tea.Overall, I found PBT's performance of The Nutcracker to be engaging and enjoyable, and I'd definitely pay to see it again.  While this was the first live ballet performance I've seen, I thought that the dancing, costumes, scenery, and choreography very good to excellent.  I'm glad that this show is a Christmas tradition in Pittsburgh--it's definitely one that I plan on taking advantage of regularly in the future!\n",

            "Original: What fun!  My oldest (5) and I ditched daddy and baby sister to come out for the 2014 production of Nutcracker and it was delightful.  Our tickets (thank you Yelp!) were in the orchestra level and we had a great view of the production.  I was surprised at how many other kids were in the theater, and I think for the length and time of night I wouldn't have wanted to take anyone younger than my almost-six-year-old.So, the ballet. It was set in Pittsburgh, which was fun, and there were some additions we hadn't see before, like the mysterious Nephew.  The dancing was wonderful, as expected.  My daughter was confused about the lack of dialog, but the program had a very helpful synopsis that helped her understand what was happening.  The first act was fun, with magic acts, dancing \"dolls\" and of course the fight with the rats and mice, and quite enjoyable.  The ending of the first act was quite soothing, and in the dark theater I admit I was afraid of snoozing!The second act.  The national dances were amazing, especially the arabian dance (Holy cow, talk about amazing abs!!!).  Then it got to the point where the sugar plum fairy danced, then her consort danced, then they danced together, then the fairy danced...and it did drag a little.  I loved the creativity, though, of the carousel, and the imagination of the set and costumes.  There was a part with the lambs that was awfully cute, and we loved watching the kids any time they were on stage.  There were several \"side stories\" going on in the periphery of the stage that you could get absorbed in, and it was just very well done.  Overall, I think that this will now be our Christmas tradition.  It was wonderful.\n",

            "Original: I can't believe the reviews that this place has received so far!  WOW!!I concede, yes it is very expensive when compared to other gyms, but a BMW is expense when compared to a Ford....In my life I've belonged to The Courthouse (tiny gym), LA Fitness, ASU Student Rec Center, Q Fitness (now 24 hour fitness) and the YMCA and I can honestly say that all pale in comparison to this facility.  Quick disclaimer: Not all LifeTime Fitness centers are the same!  The one in Gilbert is great, but not as amazing as this facility.  When I moved to MN (home of LifeTime Fitness) I actually plotted out where we would live based on the proximity to one of their gyms.  The closest one to me is in no way comparable to the facility in Tempe and as a result we are no longer members.  If I lived even remotely close to a facility like this one I would join again in a heartbeat.  Now on to the review.My wife actually signed us up under the family plan without me around.  When she told me how much it was (~$90month for the entire family) I was a bit put back.  But after my first visit I felt the money was well spent and that we were even getting a deal!I often describe this facility as a \"country club\".  Everything about this place is just amazing.Locker Rooms - Incredibly well appointed with a ton of space, a lounge, sauna and steam room.  The lockers are large and their cardkey system saves a lot of time for those of us that always forget to bring a lock with them.Cardio - There's no way anyone can complain about this!  Even at peak times there are almost always machines available in every category (treadmill, bike, elliptical, etc).  The machines are well maintained and the abundance of large screen TVs will keep you distracted from your achy legs.Weight Machines - You name it, they have it.  There are more here than I would ever use, but if you want to work that little muscle that connects those two things that you n ever use, they probably have a machine here to do it.Free Weights - They have a ton of free weights with some set-ups that I have yet to find in other facilities.  Plenty of space to workout and plenty of weights for everyone to use.Basketball - Two full size courts that are open and clean.  Great courts to play on.Squash - Probably my one complaint is that they have squash courts and no racquetball courts.  Of course most would argue that squash is more technical than racquetball and I should get some skill and stop bitching.Rock Climbing - Probably one of the most underused aspects of the gym.  I rarely saw people on this, but is was a heck of a set-up!Tennis - This was extra and since I'm not much of a tennis player I didn't sign up for this feature, but it seemed like a nice facility.Pool - Indoor and outdoor pools, so you can swim all year long.  The outdoor pool had some AMAZING \"scenery\" during the warmer months.  I wouldn't go so far as to compare it to a Vegas hotel pool, but it was darn impressive!Kid Zone - This is one of the things that sold it for us.  The facility for kids was outstanding, with separate areas set up for different ages and an abundance of activities and areas for all kids.  Indoor, lower hood basketball.  Outdoor play area.  Huge indoor \"jungle gym\".  Computers.  Crafts.  This truly was an amazing part of the gym.  And the great thing is, if you want to relax instead of work out, this aspect of the gym becomes even more helpful!  You want to get a haircut and a massage  Drop the kids off and head to the spa!  You want to sit back and relax  Drop the kids off and head to the pool or hot tub.  The kids look forward to it and it's great for the parents!Spa - My wife used this more than me and was happy with the experiences that she had here.  We didn't use it as much as we could have, but no complaints.Cafe - Decent food for a little cafe in a gym.  I ate many a breakfast there on my way to work after a cardio session.  Overall I just don't think that I've ever been in a better gym.  Yes it's expensive, but even at a higher price I feel as if I always got a good deal for the money I spent.\n",

            "Translated: I can't believe the reviews that this place has received so far!  WOW!!I concede, yes it is very expensive when compared to other gyms, but a BMW is expense when compared to a Ford....In my life I've belonged to The Courthouse (tiny gym), LA Fitness, ASU Student Rec Center, Q Fitness (now 24 hour fitness) and the YMCA and I can honestly say that all pale in comparison to this facility.  Quick disclaimer: Not all LifeTime Fitness centers are the same!  The one in Gilbert is great, but not as amazing as this facility.  When I moved to MN (home of LifeTime Fitness) I actually plotted out where we would live based on the proximity to one of their gyms.  The closest one to me is in no way comparable to the facility in Tempe and as a result we are no longer members.  If I lived even remotely close to a facility like this one I would join again in a heartbeat.  Now on to the review.My wife actually signed us up under the family plan without me around.  When she told me how much it was (~$90month for the entire family) I was a bit put back.  But after my first visit I felt the money was well spent and that we were even getting a deal!I often describe this facility as a \"country club\".  Everything about this place is just amazing.Locker Rooms - Incredibly well appointed with a ton of space, a lounge, sauna and steam room.  The lockers are large and their cardkey system saves a lot of time for those of us that always forget to bring a lock with them.Cardio - There's no way anyone can complain about this!  Even at peak times there are almost always machines available in every category (treadmill, bike, elliptical, etc).  The machines are well maintained and the abundance of large screen TVs will keep you distracted from your achy legs.Weight Machines - You name it, they have it.  There are more here than I would ever use, but if you want to work that little muscle that connects those two things that you n ever use, they probably have a machine here to do it.Free Weights - They have a ton of free weights with some set-ups that I have yet to find in other facilities.  Plenty of space to workout and plenty of weights for everyone to use.Basketball - Two full size courts that are open and clean.  Great courts to play on.Squash - Probably my one complaint is that they have squash courts and no racquetball courts.  Of course most would argue that squash is more technical than racquetball and I should get some skill and stop bitching.Rock Climbing - Probably one of the most underused aspects of the gym.  I rarely saw people on this, but is was a heck of a set-up!Tennis - This was extra and since I'm not much of a tennis player I didn't sign up for this feature, but it seemed like a nice facility.Pool - Indoor and outdoor pools, so you can swim all year long.  The outdoor pool had some AMAZING \"scenery\" during the warmer months.  I wouldn't go so far as to compare it to a Vegas hotel pool, but it was darn impressive!Kid Zone - This is one of the things that sold it for us.  The facility for kids was outstanding, with separate areas set up for different ages and an abundance of activities and areas for all kids.  Indoor, lower hood basketball.  Outdoor play area.  Huge indoor \"jungle gym\".  Computers.  Crafts.  This truly was an amazing part of the gym.  And the great thing is, if you want to relax instead of work out, this aspect of the gym becomes even more helpful!  You want to get a haircut and a massage  Drop the kids off and head to the spa!  You want to sit back and relax  Drop the kids off and head to the pool or hot tub.  The kids look forward to it and it's great for the parents!Spa - My wife used this more than me and was happy with the experiences that she had here.  We didn't use it as much as we could have, but no complaints.Cafe - Decent food for a little cafe in a gym.  I ate many a breakfast there on my way to work after a cardio session.

            "Original: God Bless Lifetime Fitness.First off, let me tell you how much I despise working out.  Like, at times I'd rather drink my own pee than even come within 50 feet of the stair stepper.  However, LTF (have you noticed that I like to abbreviate  Get used to it friends...)  makes my gym experience fairly painless.  Steve W, I salute you for aknowledging the value of such a fine work-out establishment, and I actually have many of the same opinions. But because I like to hear myself talk, I'll reiterate some of my favorite points.First off, I'm absolutely not a fan of children.  Especially at a gym.  Lifetime has FREE childcare for kiddos 12 and under so us singles can flirt our way through our workout without your kids sniffling and screaming.  Kids can play and swim outside under parental supervision at the pool, complete with waterslides and some kid-specifc water fountain spray thing.  They love it.  And I do too.  WATERSLIDES  I mean come on.  LoveitLoveit.Lifetime's members span the board, which is nice because I like the fact that I'm not the most out of shape person there.  I also like that there is nice scenery to watch and inspire me to keep my feet on that god forsaken stair stepper.  You may even see a professional athelete or TV personality on occasion.  Who doesnt love thatYou never wait for a piece of equipement because there are tons of machines.  And they are not covered in meathead sweat, which is always nice.My favorite part of LTF is the group classes.  Excellent teachers, classes every day of the week, and a good variety of options.  I'd like to see more coreographed classes like Hip-Hop, but whatever, Kickboxing Jam is pretty damn close.   Locker rooms are always spotless, towel service is free, sauna and steam rooms arent full of weirdo naked people, and they have this device that dries your bathing suit in under a minute.  Ingenious!  I've been a member of a ton of Scottsdale gyms but I drive the extra 20 minutes in rush hour to go to the Tempe LTF.  Doesnt road rage burn calories anyway  Win-win situation.\n",

There were plenty of people in all stages of fitness, so I didn't stand out at all.   That helped tremendously!Most of the classes are mulit-level, so you can join in and work on your fitness level without feeling intimidated.  The Hydro Training class is amazing!  Classes are scheduled 7 days a week, with hours to fit all schedules.  Instructors are helpful and motivating, never judgemental.My son is 12, so he's old enough to do his own thing.  I never worry about his safety in this huge facility.  I don't have a lot of experience with the childcare, but I've heard nothing but positives.  I only WISH this place had been around when my son was younger!The facility is always clean and even at peek times there are plenty of machines available.  They limit enrollment to ensure this.It may be a bit on the pricey side as far as most gyms go but the services and amenities are FAR FAR superior to any other gym in my experience.  Tons of classes, indooroutdoor pools with slides, hot tubs, saunas, steam rooms, nice locker rooms, free towel service, tennis, racquetball, squash, rock climbing, basketball, volleyball, spa, cafe, etc etc etc.  What more could anyone want  I'd gladly pay twice as much for all that we enjoy at LTF!  It keeps me motivated and interested in a variety of workout options, which keeps me coming back regularly.\n",

It is fast, physical, the game can turn on an instant, can be offensively explosive or a defensive struggle, and the fans at a hockey game are \"highly emotional\".The Pens and their fans have come a long way and right now they are one of the best fan bases in the NHL.On a side note, IMO, the nacho's at the Mellon Arena are the best nacho's in the world.  Maybe it has something to do with the environment.\n",

Throw in the ultra yellow unis when Mario came aboard and hoo ha, lookin' good there, Randy Carlyle.Loved the fact during the Cup years they were the first team with a bunch of players with big 's (55 Larry Murphy, 92 Rick Tocchet, 68 Jaromir Jagr and 66). Had a blast at the Igloo--great location, cool design. Hope the new arena measures up.Now throw in Sydney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin nowadays and it's a team that always is entertaining to watch.

When I say casually, I mean whenever I saw there was one on TV and there was nothing else to watch. And then after the lockout, things changed. I started watching any hockey games whenever they were on. Now, I am so addicted that hockey has really become such an important aspect in my life. Everything else now takes a backseat to hockey. I actually started dating a guy who did not like *any* sports on TV but now loves the Penguins too. I have to say that over the last few years, the Penguins have brought so much joy into my life and I am so happy that they won the Stanley Cup while I was living here.

In college and highschool I went to many games and when I moved to Pittsburgh going to the Pens games became one of the best times I would look forward to. When I first moved we weren't doing so hot so the games were affordable, and easily attended. So my love of the Pens did not grow from fair weathered admiration. We have the best team in the league and soon after,  we won the cup!! Love, love, love! It's such a \"livable\" city that it's possible to run into these athletes all over town! I won't give away where I've seen practically the whole team on many nights surrounded by puck bunnies sooo...get out there!  It's fun to see that SOME of them are respectable young men and behave, unlike many the football player. Sorry Stillers the Pens are number 1!! Lets go Pens!\n",

Bad owners, bad management, a record of terrible draft picks, even the mascot died! True story, in the early days, when the Penguins wore blue everyday, they had a live penguin who would walk on the ice between periods. Well, it died. A promising rookie also died the same year in a car accident. The Penguins seemed like a team with a curse attached to it. Until...In 1984 the Penguins were the worst team in the league, finishing dead last. But what a year to finish last. We earned the first pick in the entry draft which brought current co-owner and the greatest player to ever lace up skates, Mario Lemieux. Finally, our luck was changing, and Mario brought two Stanley Cups to the City of Champions. But, again, the curse was back, more bad management, bad draft picks, and chapter eleven gave Mario the chance to co-own the team. Could history repeat itself Again, the Penguins were one of the worst teams in the league, and winning the draft lottery, earned the right to draft Sydney Crosby. A year earlier they drafted Geeno Malkin. Giving them the two best players in hockey. A few years later, Sid the Kid hoisted the Stanley Cup and brought Pittsburgh It's third cup. Then, the Penguin's home began to crumble and needed a new place to play. Kansas City lured the Pens with a new hockey rink, Las Vegas also wanted them. Could we lose our Pens Finally the city and state came up with the cash to build the Penguins their new home! Now, lets bring the Cup back to Pittsburgh and party all summer long!\n",

Owner was very nice, offers complimentary wine in the evening and good full continental breakfast. All of that for only $135 a night! A short ride from everything. Includes free parking.\n",

            "Original: I was so lucky to stumble upon the Priory! I came to Pittsburgh for a conference. The Westin at the convention center was booked, so I had to find alternative lodging and came across this place. I love this hotel.  The historic building is beautiful.  The beds are comfortable. The staff are very friendly and helpful.  They have a wonderful free continental breakfast in the morning.  It's near bars and restaurants, a nail salon, and a grocery store (I was surprised to find that beer is not sold in grocery stores in Pennsylvania.  Luckily, you can buy a variety of chilled beers at the front desk, which is open 24 hrs). The local pizza place delivers until 2 am.  It's walking distance to the Andy Warhol Museum.  Also, it's only a 2 minute drive from the convention center and much cheaper than the Westin.  I paid $105night. The tv was very small and the water pressure was weak, but everything else exceeded my expectations.\n",

            "Original: One thing Pittsburgh is not known for, but should be, is turning old churches into businesses, homes and even bars (gasp!).  Most of the churches are so beautiful that it's such a great use of space.  This is no exception, as it's just so unique inside! If you're looking for that nontraditional hotel that's NOT a Marriott or Hilton, this is the place you'll want to stay!  It's fashioned like a European boutique hotel, plus all the amenities you'd be looking for like WiFi, a shuttle and continental breakfast (score!). It's also a really lovely place to have an event.  For smaller events you can rent out specific parlor's for a reasonable cost and you're able to bring in your own caterers.  I really like this option because you're not boxed into one choice that may be out of price range.  If I would have gotten married in Pittsburgh, this would  definitely have been my first choice for the reception.  The Grand Hall is just gorgeous!  It has the original church organ and stain glass windows.  When it's all dressed up for the event it's just a stunning place for a magical affair! The Northside of town, where it's located, has walkable access to the Andy Warhol Museum, The Mattress Factory Museum, The Children's Museum, The National Aviary, The Carnegie Science Center, PNC Park (home to the Pirates, go bucks!) and Heinz Field (home to the Stillerz, as we call them in the burgh).  Some are farther than others, but there's always the shuttle if it's in our frigid winter season.  In the summer, go for the walk so you can take in the sights!There's also a lot of cute restaurants and bars on East Ohio River Boulevard, which is two streets up from the hotel.  My suggestions would be Bistro to Go and Bistro Soul, Rita's Italian Ice (personal fave) or The Priory Bakery for dessert!  There's also Legends North Shore not far on E. North Ave. about two streets up from E. Ohio and Amani Coffee Shop and Cafe for a quick stop for coffee or a great panini for lunch.   It's really a fantastic time to go in the summer because EVERYTHING is within walking distance.  Plus they have a great farmers market in the park right along E. Ohio and they have kayaking in the park right by the Aviary.  The big kayaking organization, Venture Outdoors is right under the 6th St. Bridge next to PNC Park.  You're able to kayak around the three rivers for only $15 an hour!  It's a great way to see the city!This is your place for one unique stay, I wouldn't steer you wrong!\n",

The individual rooms, all named for varieties of apple, are spectacular.  We were in the lovely Northern Spy.  The bed was wonderfully comfortable, the linens unbelievably soft and luxurious.  L'Occitane bath products smelled divine.  The Shadyside neighborhood outside of downtown is quiet but still conveniently located to all the Pittsburgh doings.Breakfast each morning, cooked by the hospitable Chef Jackie, is pure pleasure.  Each night on your pillow a menu card appears; check off what you'd like in the morning, what time you'll be eating, and drop it off in the dining room.  The next day, Jackie is ready and waiting with a fresh fruit plate, the pastry of the day, and fantastically strong and flavorful coffee.  Omelets and fritattas are made with local produce and eggs.  Irish oatmeal is served with milk from a nearby creamery.  Toast bread changes daily but is always whole-grain and delicious.  Breakfast meats are lean and filling.  Afternoons, iced tea and cookies are set out, and in the evenings wine and cheese served.  Enjoy them in a rocker on the front porch, relaxing on the back deck retreat, or in the privacy of your room.  Staff is not only eminently professional, but warm and gracious.  Heidi at the front desk was beyond helpful in making suggestions for what to do in the city or where to eat (I will be forever indebted to her for recommending what was probably our best meal of the trip at Soba).  If you ever find yourself in Pittsburgh, lodgings can't get much better than the Inn on Negley.That's probably sufficient gushing.\n",

            "Original: Pittsburgh has a Four Seasons!From Paris to Shanghai, London to Bangkok, the care with which this little B&B operation is run in Pittsburgh exceeds the best that I have experienced in any of these cities.It may not have the conference facilities of a larger hotel, the business center, or in-house spa, but as a B&B, this is about as good as it gets. The structure in which the whole thing is held (do we call it a 'house') is old (perhaps we could say it generically to be 'victorian') with decor to match. These are far from our tastes, but they compensate (in our eyes) by taking good care of what they have. The TVs aren't even old flat screens, but they do stock the rooms thoroughly with l'occitane.Where this place really shines is in the staff and the food. I actually find this aspect to be _better_ or even _much_ better than many celebrated big-city five-star properties. When was the last time that the night staff pulled some food from the refrigerator (gratis) after a midnight arrival caused by flight delaysThey make everything in-house and it is all extraordinary. On this last visit, I indulged in their traditional french toast with a side of eggs. I forgot that this all includes an additional course in advance with fruit (not just big grocery store chucks of melon) and house-made cookies and muffins. On each visit, they mix these up. For this December visit, they did gingerbread cookies (of course). The Chef (Jackie), from NYC, could be gainfully employed high up the hierarchy of any top big-city restaurant.There is no elevator, so either pack light if you want a room on the 3rd floor or choose a 1st or 2nd floor room. The 1st floor room has double doors so I didn't find it any noisier than the others. You are in a city and on a reasonably busy street, so don't expect the charming home to be continued into a surrounding yard (although they do have an attractive new deck out back).\n",

            "Original: As a non-native Pittsburgher, I would say the Sunnyledge brunch tops Grand Concourse.  Not in the quantity, but in the service and the ambience.  It's funny how often I passed by this place turning onto Fifth coming down from Wilkins, but didn't try it until my last weekend in Pittsburgh.I came here on my last Sunday in Pittsburgh after I had posted a list of things I wanted to do before leaving.  The Sunnyledge owner offered a deal and graciously gave the 4 of us a round of mimosas.  Along with this deal, we had an incredible brunch.The 4 of us were sat on the porch, overlooking Fifth which wasn't that loud.  The brunch came with an entree and a buffet.  I love perfectly-sized portions and this one was it.  I had a lobster club sandwich which was great.  The brunch buffet was held in a room in the lobby, which was quaint and small.  Caviar.  Small pastries.  Just the perfect balance of sweet and savory.  Even though the crowd here were a little more upscale and classy (one of the few places that I saw valet parking), I never felt that I was treated any less (I was a poor graduate student with a love of food).The only drawback was that the tables and chairs were somewhat cramped.

            "Translated: As a non-native Pittsburgher, I would say the Sunnyledge brunch tops Grand Concourse.  Not in the quantity, but in the service and the ambience.  It's funny how often I passed by this place turning onto Fifth coming down from Wilkins, but didn't try it until my last weekend in Pittsburgh.I came here on my last Sunday in Pittsburgh after I had posted a list of things I wanted to do before leaving.  The Sunnyledge owner offered a deal and graciously gave the 4 of us a round of mimosas.  Along with this deal, we had an incredible brunch.The 4 of us were sat on the porch, overlooking Fifth which wasn't that loud.  The brunch came with an entree and a buffet.  I love perfectly-sized portions and this one was it.  I had a lobster club sandwich which was great.  The brunch buffet was held in a room in the lobby, which was quaint and small.  Caviar.  Small pastries.  Just the perfect balance of sweet and savory.  Even though the crowd here were a little more upscale and classy (one of the few places that I saw valet parking), I never felt that I was treated any less (I was a poor graduate student with a love of food).The only drawback was that the tables and chairs were somewhat cramped.  I had to struggle with getting out of my chair each time to go to the buffet.

It's truly an amazing house.   Walking around the place, you can really start to feel as if you've gone back in time.  I only saw one guest room, but it was impressive.  very well appointed with antique furniture, it had a separate sitting room with its own couch, and the views were of the thick stand of trees to the east and south of the house.I also really liked the enclosure of live australian finches downstairs.  They're colorful, lively things to watch, and I was told that sometimes the cat they keep around the house just sits around staring at the birds.Anyway, if you've got guest coming from out of town who are into antique and ornate surroundings, they would do well to stay at the Morehead Inn.\n",

If you come here, I would highly recommend carpooling.  From the parking lot, I was able to walk right to the conference room they had for us.  As soon as I walked in, I felt like I went back in time.  The decorations there were beautiful and made me feel like I had to drink tea with my pinky out.  The only gripe I have about their decorations was that they had plates with Slytherin colors.  How can they support the evil house in Harry Potter!!!  Other than that, everything was perfect.They do not have that many bathrooms, but it is understandable since it is an old house.  I wouldn't want them to change that anyways.  I wasn't able to explore more in the Inn, but all the things I was able to see I loved.  The staff was also very friendly, so kudos to that!\n",

            "Original: Goodbye Hotels!  After this cozy little place I'm a bed and breakfast faithful.  Our host, Craig, was wonderful.  It was super easy to make the arrangements and the website was helpful.  The place itself gave me the same joy I remember having when I would go see grandparents as a child.  That feeling of a warm house.  Oh, did I mention that when we first entered the whole house smelled of breakfast from that morning.  The bed half of the name was extra comfortable and the room was very relaxing.  We stayed in the Sorenson room, which was a little larger and had a couch.  They offered a small bookshelf of books and Madison magazine (which helped us to find our restaurant the next day).  The Sorenson room also offers a private bathroom with a claw-foot tub that is over 110 years old (but has excellent water pressure).  Shampoo, soap, body gel, bath salts (I think that's what they were), and even a hairdryer are all provided.  This was nice since we forgot a couple of those things.  For the breakfast portion, we had a spinach and cheddar quiche that was the fluffiest damn quiche I've ever had.  Pardon my French! My fiance is a Vegetarian and it was extremely easy to make.  He also had a myriad of drink options.  Some ready to be poured, some in waiting.  Also, for me (the non-vegetarian), he made an incredible side of bacon.  It was sprinkled with brown sugar and then generously peppered.  Then it was baked.  Then it was devoured with great speed.  Seriously, this was heavenly.  Also, there was a delicious pear and cranberry compote for each of us. Craig and his beautiful (and friendly) dog joined us for breakfast and some wonderful conversation.  He is a true gentleman and an excellent host.  My fiance and I are planning another trip in the spring and we'll be sure to stay with them again.  I could't recommend this place enough.\n",

So happy we chose to stay at The Parsonage for a girls weekend to Madison.The highlights:- Location: While the B&B is about 25 minutes from downtown Madison, it's very easy to get to. The perk of being off the beaten path is, well, being off the beaten path. - Price: The three of us chose the top floor Reverend's Retreat, which can actually sleep up to 6. It had the feel of your parent's attic, but in a good, comfortable way. For the Friday & Saturday night, it was about comparable to what we would've paid to stay at a fancy-pants place in Madison.- Food: Oh my goodness, can Craig cook! The breakfasts alone would've been worth $20person at a restaurant. Definitely try the juice blend - you won't look at orange and cranberry juice the same way again. - The company: On the weekend we were there, we (late 20searly 30s) had the pleasure of staying with younger groups of people. Chatting at the communal breakfast table was a nice perk and a great way to get some new tips on what to see & do in Madison. And, Craig and his wife have two lovely dogs. If you're in town, definitely look up & consider The Parsonage.\n",

There was an assortment of soaps, shampoos, bubble baths etc in the bathroom too.  The room and bathroom were clean and spotless.  Craig was extremely nice, helpful, and whipped up a killer breakfast.... a brown sugary, apple, cranberry, upside down baked french toast kind of concoction, homemade pumpkin bread, fresh watermelon, and sausage links.  He was very accomodating and asked us the night before if there were any allergies or food issues that he needed to know about.  The price was very affordable, and the next time I'm in the area I'll be staying there instead of a hotel.  : )\n",

            "Original: Loved staying here.  We were going up to Madison for the day and found this place through a quick Google search of Madison-area B&B's.  Craig (the owner) was so helpful and friendly when I called to inquire about prices and availability.  He was also awesome and asked about our dietary preferences (I'm a vegetarian who's also temporarily gluten-free, whereas my boyfriend will eat anything) and promised to have a yummy breakfast we would both love.  When we got to The Parsonage, I was so happy we decided to stay there instead of in Madison proper.  It was quiet and cozy.  We picked the Mentor room which had a big awesome jacuzzi tub in there, and also a really nice outdoor patio (which was covered in snow, but i bet will be awesome when spring comes!).   Our bed was SO COMFORTABLE, i think i actually miss it.  Since our room didn't have a shower (which we knew when we booked - well worth it to have that awesome bathtub!), I used the shared bathroom on the second floor which was also very nice and cozy.  Breakfast the next day was so nice.  Craig made homemade cranberry orange muffins with a cheesy kale egg dish - so yummy!  Everyone else got delicious smelling bacon, and Craig very awesomely made me veggie breakfast sausage.  There was also pineapple, juice, and a really great tea selection.  The conversation was also really nice - I like that we all ate together (me, my boyfriend, Craig, and the 5 other guests who were staying there.  Great people and great company.  Next time we are in the Madison area, we will definitely stay here.  Craig, thanks for all the hospitality!  From Denise and Justin\n",

            "Original: I should have left this review back in November when I stayed here with my parents - every time I look through our vacation photos I think about how much fun I had showing them Madison... and how we enjoyed where we stayed just as much.  Pat and Bob and Happy (their dog) were wonderful and their food was amazing.  They make many of the ingredients on their property (fresh maple syrup anyone).  Would go back in a heartbeat.\n",

            "Original: By far the best B & B I have stayed in (I have stayed in about 5 in my life thus far). Huge breakfasts that were yummy and a lovely, relaxing atmosphere. My co-traveler and I honestly decided to stay in the inn rather than go into Madison on a Saturday night because it was that cozy. We are not 80 but in our late 20searly 30s!You can hear the highway when you sit outside, but it's kind of like the sound of strong winds. It's hard to believe that the property is that close to downtown Madison, yet it's a farm. Although I like to try out different B & B's, just for different experiences, I would strongly consider staying there again for a weekend getaway.\n",

            "Original: My business partner and I stayed at the Speckled Hen by chance while on business in Madison.  All hotels were booked and we were lucky enough to get a room here.  I can't say enough about this B&B.  We were overly impressed with the Inn, the Inn Keepers, our rooms and the breakfasts OMG!!! Awesome ;)   I felt at home here, my room was extremely comfy and cozy and quiet.  Breakfast is served in your time and is one of my favorite parts of the stay.  Every morning its something new and exciting and Delicious!!!  The Inn Keepers and warm and friendly and the conversation was never dull.  I will stay here whenever I'm in Madison.  The price and the service go way beyond the cost of any hotel I've stayed in...  This place is a real find.  There are also hiking trails, farm animals, and an abundantly beautiful property.  If that isn't enough a good deal of what is served for breakfast is grown on the property.    To say it in one word, AWESOME!!!!!\n",

            "Original: This was our first B&B expierence and it was amazing! We stayed here June 2012 for a birthday weekend. The owners made us feel very special and right at home. Our room, the Madison Lakes Room, was huge and the bathroom was spectacular. I loved the steam shower! The property is large and a great place to take a walk during the day. They are also lots of outdoor seating areas to sit and enjoy the scenery or read a book. The breakfast was great, I think we had 3 courses a day of food. Pat makes a great breakfast and Bob provides good company during the meal. Their dog Happy is also a companion while you eat or walk the property. They do also have snacks in the lounge area for you to enjoy at anytime. There are sodas in the fridge and sometimes fresh baked cookies!\n",

            "Original: Inviting, comfortable, quite, homey, elegant, and friendly are words that come to mind when thinking of our stay at the Speckled Hen.  My wife and I came here for our anniversary and we were not disappointed with any aspect.   Upon arrival we were met by the Inn Keeper, Pat who gave us a warm welcome and brief tour of the gust areas and our room.   The guest area, or as they call it, the \"gathering room\" is very warm & inviting.   Here you can sit to meet with others, read a book, select a wine, or enjoy complementary drinks such as coffee, tea or soda with some light snacks available as well.   The freshly baked cookies are awesome.    There is also a computer to use if you wish and there are several binders and folders with local attractions or restaurants to try out.   Our room, the \"Madison Lakes\" was outstanding.  Large, and outfitted extremely well. You will not be disappointed.  There is a king sized bed, a gas fireplace, nice sized TV, with good cable channels, or use of a DVD (you can borrow DVD's from the gathering room), free wifi, a small fridge, sink, and two comfortable chairs to melt into.   The bathroom is ginormous, with a large whirlpool tub, a huge walk in shower complete with steam and rainfall shower head, all of it being very nice.   The grounds of the Inn is really a small farm, with fruits, veggies & fresh laid eggs that find their way into the ingredients for breakfast.    Around the far there are several trails to use, winding you past the barn, sheep, a lama and various beds for wild flowers, herbs and vegetables.   As my wife and I walked the grounds and headed back to the Inn, we passed a good sized gazebo which seemed to beckon us in for a look.  Inside there are a few comfortable chairs, wine cooler,  a DVD player (with aux connections) and some wine glasses just waiting to be used.   We sat in there for a while and we actually had plans on going out on the town.  However, this entire scenery before us was extremely relaxing... the woods, birds singing, farm animals grazing about, all made for an extremely, wonderful  relaxing environment we simply could not walk away from.   So, we concluded our evening by enjoying ourselves in this tranquil environment accompanied with some wine.    Ahhh... a very memorable time which we shall cherish for some time to come.   After a sound sleep and outstanding shower, we headed to breakfast where we dinned with two other couples who clearly were enjoying their stay as well.  The breakfast freshly made by the Inn Keepers, Pat & Bob, is made up of several courses; fruit, scones, beacon and eggs, all of which was eaten with delight and a perfect ending chapter of our stay at the Speckled Hen Inn B&B.  The attention given by the Inn Keepers, Pat & Bob is perfect.  They have really taken care of many of your needs in advance simply by setting up the Inn & Grounds really well.  They are both attentive and engaging while at the same time not being overbearing.   They really do have it well balanced!   Obviously, my wife & I will be checking back in here again.  So, if you are looking for a place to get away from to unwind, (which is only a short drive from the Capitol Square) or in need of some quite time, then this is the place for you!   Thanks Speckled Hen, for such a relaxing time and creating some wonderful memories!!!\n",

            "Original: This place was wonderful all around. I would return and I would recommend. It is a bit higher price point, but it is such a great space it is worth it. If you are looking to get away, relax, have a romantic weekend, enjoy nature, this is a great place. If you just need a place to sleep you might want something less expensive (unless you can afford it). The first floor of the house is very clean and neat, but has a very comfortable and cozy feel. There is a small kitchenette stocked with coffee, tea, cold drinks and lite snacks. If we stayed longer I could see relaxing down there enjoying a glass of wine, playing a game or reading. There is a nice selection of wine available to purchase so you don't even have to go out. Our room was very nice. King sized bed, robes, our own deck with a great view of the sheep. The bathroom had a big Jacuzzi tub and a large duel-head shower. We enjoyed glasses of champagne on the deck before heading out to explore and hike around their land. He had dinner downtown Madison which was an easy drive to and from. When we returned we were happy to have the fireplace in our room and cozied up with some of freshly baked cookies left out for guests. Breakfast was delicious. Farm fresh eggs from their hen's, herbs from the garden and all the other ingredients were local. We had good conversation with the other couple staying there as well as the owners.Great place!\n",

            "Original: An adorable surprise of an Inn in the middle of absolutely nowhere.  I was doing a long-distance bike ride through AZ and booked a room here only bc Florence seemed like a good stopping point before a full-day ride to Tucson.  From the moment I rode up to the entrance of the courtyard, I was astounded.  The courtyard has a tranquil appeal, complete with a water fountain to soothe what ails you.  The room I was in (Dolores) was delightfully decorated and outfitted w the comfiest queen sized bed, TV, fridge, hairdryer, French soaps and shampoo, and vintage bedside reads.  And in the morning, there was breakfast, during which Linda, the owner, offered me extra food to pack for my ride to Tucson.  What a treat to have found this place.  This would be the perfect place to take a quiet long weekend escape from the hustle of life and read, write, breathe and just be still.  I intend to come back soon.\n",

And her dogs are charming too.  You get so much more than what you pay for.  The breakfast is technically a continental breakfast, but it really leaves you satisfied - yogurt, toast, fruit, juice, coffee, cereal, oatmeal, all kinds of good stuff.  The beds are comfortable and the rooms are spotless.  My favorite feature is the pool area - a two person hammock, spa with a little waterfall, and a grill that guests can use for BBQs.  Lovely place to get away for a night or two...and really feel like you took a vacation.\n",

The room was spacious, clean and comfortable. The entire Inn was beautifully decorated for Christmas. Karl and Jeff are wonderful hosts. We had made dinner reservations at a local restaurant, but upon arrival at the Inn were told that Jeff prepared a special New Year's eve dinner for the guests. He is a wonderful chef...dinner was delicious. The next morning he prepared a special New Year's Day breakfast of quiche and potatoes, in addition to the cold, every day breakfast items the normally serve. The restaurant is only open for private dinners. I suggest taking bottled water, winebeer, sodas & snacks with you, as there is nothing \"right there\" to get those types of things. Free parking on the street and easy walk to downtown and Heinz field. Highly recommend!!\n",

            "Original: During my recent visit to Pittsburgh I lived like a baron in the Mr. Boggs' Suite while staying with friends Karl Kargle and his partner in life and business Jeffrey Stasko at the former Boggs Mansion, beautifully restored and now called The Inn on the Mexican War Streets.

The Inn itself is gorgeous inside and out and Karl is a fabulous and gracious host. Our room, which included a private bath and sitting area was beautiful, clean, and very comfortable. The free wi-fi came in handy and was easily accessible from our room (the Emma room).Breakfast, though self serve, was good. There is a waffle maker and a toaster for English muffins or bagels. Fruit, pastries, cereal, and yogurt were also available, along with hard-boiled eggs.Street parking was never a problem and we felt very safe while staying at the Inn. We would highly recommend it for anyone visiting the Pittsburgh area.\n",

Our host, Jeff, was extremely gracious and accommodating.  His chocolate chip cookies were made from scratch and delicious.  Looking at previous reviews, I accessed the Internet and had no trouble.  That said, if you need the Internet that bad, this bed and breakfast would be wasted on you.  The location is great.  We walked to the National Aviary and the river walk and enjoyed the beautiful park across the street.\n",

            "Original: I stayed at The Inn on Mexican War Streets for one night in late May, 2014. I stayed in Mr. Bogg's room and felt a bit like a wealthy tycoon in the large grand room!The Inn has a very grand appearance on the outside, which continues on the inside. While not in pristine condition, the inside is certainly not shabby, and is clean. My bed was very comfortable. I met only one of the two innkeepers (sorry, I don't recall his name), but he was very nice and helpful. I wouldn't say the neighborhood is packed with restaurants and bars, but there are several (good ones!) within a three to four block walk. There's also a nice park immediate across the street from the Inn.If I need to return to Pittsburgh, I'll certainly stay at the Inn on Mexican War Streets again (you should too!).\n",

Everything was within walking distance, including the Aviary, the Children's Museum, the Mattress Factory (an art gallery), Randyland, etc.   There is also a beautiful park right across the road.

Anyone looking to escape the hustle and bustle of everyday life, look no further.  The Duke Mansion will transport you back in time, to when life was a bit slower and finer.The rooms at this place are exquisite.  This place is one of rare vintage indeed.  The first thing I noticed about our room was that the ceilings were well over 15 feet high.  You just don't fined places like that anymore.  And the entire mansion is both bright, and spotless.  Very well kept.The grounds are astonishingly well kept.  You can spend an hour walking around the grounds, just adoring the flowers, exotic local birds and landscaping.It's obvious that a lot of people get married at the Duke Mansion, and that's no surprise.  Highly recommend you check this place out if you're getting married in NC, or would be willing to travel to NC to get married, just to do something different for a change.The breakfast was spot on.  Basic Southern food, delicious to the core.  The staff are super friendly.  Typical of the South though :-)Another great facet about the Duke Mansion is it's proximity to downtown Charlotte and other lively, nearby suburban neighborhoods.  It's rare to find a place that seems so isolated (in a good way) but yet offers 15 minute access in any direction to whatever you want to do.TIP: Get either room 204 or 205.  These rooms share the lovely, screened in private balcony.  The balcony overlooks the fountain. It's so peaceful.  And it's massive.  There are both swings and lounge chairs.I will definitely be going back to the Duke Mansion.  This place is heavenly.  Do it!\n",

            "Original: What's not to love about the Comedy Club.  I have been going to this venue for about 5 years now (in their old and new location), and there's only been a few times where I was disappointed.  The new location has a nice huge seating area where you and a group of friends can pay an incredibly small fee to see a great show of standup comedy.Specifically, on Thursdays it's $1 with a Student ID, and Fri-Sun it's $10.  Each of these tickets requires a 2 drink minimum, but you can buy soda if you need to save on cash.  This is a great price, and there's usually 2 or 3 comics at a minimum, with some shows having as many as 6 or 7.  Usually the whole experience takes about an hour and a half to two hours, and you're almost guaranteed to have a riot.  If you look in some of the local papers, they print a coupon every week for a buy one get one free as well, and this place definitely rings true with the saying \"the more the merrier.\"  My only recommendation here is to call ahead, as the place can get packed and sometimes they need a reservation depending on the size of your party.I've been to a few other stand up comedy venues in various major cities, and also improv comedy (like Comedy Sportz), but this place stands out because they consistently get funny comics and an excited crowd.  The humor is usually intelligent (at least the headliner), or they throw enough comics at  you that one or two of them is bound to hit your funnybone.  I can't stress enough how good this place is and if you haven't been you should go next weekend.  I've had my share of memories there, from laughing so hard I had to get up and go to the bathroom (on my first date with my girlfriend of 5 years now) to laughing so hard it hurt because a comic rebuked insulting with a tirade that prompted a rude patron to leave.  The atmosphere of people is primarily college and young adults, but there are middle-aged folks as well, and a lot of parents taking their college kids out on the town.  The comedy almost never gets so raunchy that it's offensive, and most comics either have a good skit series off the bat or adapt to the crowd.  Many of them have been on Comedy Central, and several have won comedy awards.  The one thing you shouldn't expect is a giant auditorium with people on the status level of Jerry Seinfeld, but if you just want to go have a good time, laugh your heart out, and have a few drinks, this is the place.\n",

            "Original: I've always wanted to go to this place and finally made it happen this weekend! Last night I gathered my ladies and we went to the 8pm showing. The main comedian was a guy named RON MOREY - who I have never heard of but I'm not too comedian savvy.. and prefer anything other than douche bag Dane Cook-esque comedy. Such a tool. (He's lame and steals jokes from CK Louis btw!)We arrived about twenty minutes early which was good because they don't accept cards at the door, which sorta sucked.. since I thought it was 2009, but whatever. We walked to the nearest ATM, giggling and stumbling slightly due to the martinis (we consumed at Pearl previously) flowing through our veins. We went in, and just as I expected, it was a very intimate place, very cute.. although it was a little warm. We grabbed awesome seats and ordered beverages. There is a two drink minimum but the mix drinks are fairly priced at $5 - non alcoholic drinks are $3. Not bad. The show started a few minutes late but I was immediately pleased. There were three \"opening\" acts which were funny.. but man, the main comedian, RON MOREY, was hilarious. Almost peed myself a couple times.My girls and I left there still smiling and quoting some memorable jokes. I had such a great time that this WILL be a monthly event with my friends and i.Perfect for a date too, there were a lot of couples there and it was just awesome watching them get awkward and uncomfortable after a sex or date joke.. Overall, awesome-obviously.. the crowd was cool.. a mix of 20-somethings... to granny panties. I highly recommend this place.\n",

We walked to the nearest ATM, giggling and stumbling slightly due to the martinis (we consumed at Pearl previously) flowing through our veins. We went in, and just as I expected, it was a very intimate place, very cute.. although it was a little warm. We grabbed awesome seats and ordered beverages. There is a two drink minimum but the mix drinks are fairly priced at $5 - non alcoholic drinks are $3. Not bad. The show started a few minutes late but I was immediately pleased. There were three \"opening\" acts which were funny.. but man, the main comedian, RON MOREY, was hilarious. Almost peed myself a couple times.My girls and I left there still smiling and quoting some memorable jokes. I had such a great time that this WILL be a monthly event with my friends and i.Perfect for a date too, there were a lot of couples there and it was just awesome watching them get awkward and uncomfortable after a sex or date joke.. Overall, awesome-obviously.. the crowd was cool.. a mix of 20-somethings... to granny panties. I highly recommend this place.\n",
            "Original: Been here four times now. Saw The Stagebenders for two of the four shows I've been to here. GREAT show! Love this place! It's nice and small, so there is a lot of interaction. Never mean-spirited on the comic's part, always tastefully funny. Definitely make sure you get there on time. They are strict when it comes to the doors closing when the show starts. But it is a live performance; they do the same thing for the ballet at Symphony Hall, out of courtesy to the performers.\n",

We were sat in the front row, so of course we got picked on, but I don't think I've laughed that hard in a really long time.  It was a blast.   A couple things to keep in mind: 1.  The place is really small, so buy your tickets in advance or get there a little early. 2. Food is limited to a couple of \"stadium\" style appetizers, so eat first.  3. Two drink minimum, but the prices were pretty reasonable, I think our tab with tip came to $27.  4. Enjoy the comics and don't be afraid to laugh at yourself!\n",

Not all the acts are the greatest but it is a great value and it's even great when comics are not doing well (because you are still laughing at them)  The drinks are a little pricy but if not for that I am not even sure how they would make money.  I think for that it is a very fair value for live entertainment, and very great date night place to check out every month or two.  I live so far so it is an evening out for us when we make it out here but well worth the drive.  I saw a Quentin D, (cant remember his last name) but they show was so awesome and he was so funny I nearly pissed myself.  The shows before him were not as good but they weren't bad either.  It also seemed like the show lasted 2 hours in total.  I have to say that this place pretty much rocks and since it is in old town you can go bar hopping right afterward.\n",

My favorite place to sit for a date2 person party: in the back of the showroom at the high-top tables. Then you can  have some private conversation - at the tables on the floor, they seat in 4s, so if you go with a date, you will end up sitting with 2 other people- can be good for conversation, but that depends on the people you're next to.\n",

This place is also easy to get to and there is a sushi restaurant with $5 sake bombs for happy hour... and I'm not just talking about half a beer and a shot of sake.  These $5 drinks consist of a LARGE Japanese beer and a half pitcher of sake.  You can probably make 3-4 bombs out of this.

            "Original: I am starting to conclude that this might just be my most favorite place in the world right now!!! So if I ever am missing and you are wondering where to find me, try this place first! I have been to the Improv so many times and have never really been let down. Almost all the comedians I have seen are extremely talented and hilarious. Let me see if I can name all the ones I have seen: Greg Berehnt (hes just not that into you), Michael Winslow (guy from Police acadamy movies), Gabriel Iglesius, Al Madrigal, Flip Orly (hypnotist), Michael McDonald (MAD Tv, not the singer), Jamie Kennedy, Johnny Sanchez (MAD Tv), and Bob Marley (no not the dead reggae singer). I would have to say the only one that didn't make me laugh as hard was Michael Winslow, there were some slow parts during his show. The rest were terrific though. My favorite is probably a tie between Al Madrigal and Johnny Sanchez. Yes, the no names seem to be the funnier ones. May its cause you go in not expecting much and they turn out to be awesome. Anyways, if you love to laugh and have a good time, this is the place for you. Besides the entertainment, the food and drink is also decent. The hubby and I are a fan of their buffalo wings, zucchini chips, nachos, and cookie dessert. And of course, what goes better together than comedy and booze Their electric lemonade is very tasty along with the simple oldie but goodie pineapple juice and malibu.Keep in mind when ordering tickets that besides the 20 or so $ for the tickets, you will also have to buy 2 items per person which is usually another $40-$50 for a night of fun and laughs. Not a cheap outing, but a really good one for birthdays, anniversaries, etc.Oh and a final tip, if its just you and one other person going, the high top tables in the back are the best to try to request one. Otherwise, you will be sat with complete strangers at some tiny table and are literally arm and arm most of the time....Its up to you but either way, you get the same amount of puny table space when you think about it. Oh and make sure you order your tickets online as they do sell out most of the time...\n",

The first time I saw Jesterz, I was expecting it to be pretty awkward and honeslty didn't know what to expect. I was blown away how funny it got at times. Good clean funny. We went again soon after the first time but didn't go again for a good 2 years, we went back recently and was kinda worried as the crowd was not as big as past times. Even with a smaller crowd there were tons of LOL moments. Writing about it kinda makes me want to go back.\n",

It's a treat to see how five very different personality styles combine on stage to assemble stories from audience suggestions.  We took friends on our first visit and had a great time.  You'll definitely have something to talk about after the show.  I appreciate that the ground-rules keep things from veering into the gutter, thereby encouraging creativity.  That doesn't mean it's the best fit for young kids though.  The sweet spot for this \"all ages\" show is probably teens to adults.\n",

I have been 3 times now and each time I leave with my sides hurting.  The best part is that they are CLEAN comedy!  I think it takes a lot more talent to make people laugh without resorting to dirty jokes. They are improv, which means even if they play the same games, you're going to get a completely different show every time.  You're going to have fun.  Trust me!  Plus, there's really no such thing as a \"bad\" seat here.  Even in the back row you're close enough to the stage to be in on the games.  But if you can sit right in the front, I recommend it, because some of the facial expressions from the actors are priceless, especially in those rare instances that one of their team members catches them off-guard. Be sure to add them on Facebook.  Every now and then they'll have last minute specials, plus their shows frequently sell-out, and Facebook is often the quickest way to get that info so you don't have to try going to a sold-out show.Highly recommended, especially if you need a laugh.\n",

Sure sometimes some of the comics aren't as funny as I would like, but the headliner or one of the other two have always made me laugh.  The new venue is at Bally's and is past the Jubilee showroom up the escalators beside the Poker room.  The seats (which a lot of people complained about before when it was at PH) are better than before but still normal padded chairs.  The view isn't as good as it was at PH but it is a better showroom overall and is medium sized yet intimate.  They do a lot of specials as well, from Groupon to locals deals, and their last minute normal pricing is fair as well.  On top of all that, they have an all-u-can-drink special that is usually $25 but can be less if bought with packages.  So the price for an 1.5+ hour show on the strip is A+ awesome!I've met a lot of the comics after the show (not required but I like talking to them), as well as the awesome maitre d (Justin) and even the owner who is often there making sure everyone is having fun.Bottom line:  I really enjoy using the LA comedy club shows as my default date nightnight out or just something fun to do all the time, so check it out if you like comedy!\n",

            "Original: Although I have attended Louie's show in the past and loved it, the review below is based on my experience when I attended Marty Allen's birthday show.  This review originally appeared on Vegas Posh, the online magazine that my husband and I maintain.Marty Allen is what classic comedy is all about: he's funny without being offensive, charming, has spotless timing, and an arsenal of facial expressions that keep audiences laughing just as much as his jokes do.  When Allen celebrated his 90th birthday with an engagement at the Louie Anderson Theater at Palace Station, he proved to Las Vegas audiences that at 90, he's just as funny as he's ever been.Allen's wife, Karon Kate Blackwell, started off the show by showcasing her vocal talent... the kind that you only find from entertainers who had to rely on their own talent and not on high-tech studio equipment.  Allen appeared before a cheering crowd, opening with a hilarious monologue before doing his first skit, the wine taster from Caesar's Palace, an alcoholic whose wife is so ugly that \"her pictures hang themselves.\"Throughout Allen's skits, Blackwell played the straight lady, but even the straight lady couldn't help but laugh at many of his jokes.  The chemistry was undeniable and the two had trouble keeping straight faces throughout many of the skits, including the one that featured Allen as a doctor who had just written the book Everything You've Always Wanted to Know About Sex* *But Were Afraid to Ask Your Children.Between skits, Blackwell sings, dances, and plays piano.  Her performances included a high-energy rendition of \"Proud Mary\" and a deeply moving Beatles medley.Perhaps one of Allen's funniest jokes was the story of an eight year old boy who goes to the store to purchase a box of Tampax.  When the clerk asks if he knows what they're for, he responds \"Not really, but they're for my four year old brother; we saw the commercials and they said if he bought these, he would be able to swim and ride a bike and he can't do either.\"  Commenting on modern times, Allen delivered another hilarious line when he joked, \"You know times have changed when a man goes to the drug store and says (loudly) 'I'll take a box of condoms,\" (whispering with his mouth covered) \"... and a pack of cigarettes.\"Although Allen's routines are classics and many of his characters originated decades ago, he keeps his act fresh and modern, appealing as much to audiences today as to audiences of the past, without succumbing to the trend of getting cheap laughs through vulgarity.  Audiences were undoubtedly left looking forward to Allen's 91st birthday celebration.\n",

The venue is nicely intimate, so you really feel like you're getting a good live show, not just watching something on TV. I've been following his standup for years and I've read most of his books, so I feel like I already know all the people he's joking about, like his parents and siblings. Louie definitely tailors his show for the specific audience, so you'll likely get a different show every time you see him. One of the biggest laughs he got was when he was lamenting that we can't just change the constitution and vote Bill Clinton back in. The whole audience appreciated that one!I loved that he really took time to chat with people who stood in line to buy books, t-shirts, andor DVDs and signed everything. It really makes a difference from a lot of comedians who won't even emerge from the green room except to perform, then sneak out the back.Louie was excellent and if you already like his humour, this show will be a great experience.P.S. -  Drink service was attentive and the opener was great, too, which is also a rarity!\n",

He impressionates everyone from Eminem to Jimmy Stewart so all age ranges can appreciate him.His performance isn't just music, he also impersonates Hollywood actors pretty good.Others have given him bad ratings, but I would like to say he is not a hack in anyway.  He is 90 minutes of straight comedy.  The only thing I would say negative was we were in the second row and the music was a tad bit loud, so just be prepared for that.

He is 90 minutes of straight comedy.  The only thing I would say negative was we were in the second row and the music was a tad bit loud, so just be prepared for that.  If you like him as much as I did, at the end give him  the band a standing ovation and you'll get an extra performance.\n",
            "Original: I had a long day at work and my head was pounding.  When I got home, my wife tells me that my aunt got us free VIP tickets to see Gordie Brown at the Golden Nugget.  Honestly, I was tired, stressed, I had a headache, and I didn't want to go.  Good thing that my \"fabuloso wife\" convinced me otherwise.  The Gordie Brown show is located in the Golden Nugget - upstairs.  Going up the escalators, it is a bit of a maze.  Once you are in the auditorium, it  is pretty small and cozy... and yes, very comfortable.  Our seats were in the center, 4 rows from the stage.  Fantastic seats!How would I best describe it  Hmm, he is a very eclectic and an entertaining performer.  In a way, he reminds me of a Weird Al Yankovic (for those who lived through the 80s).  He takes old and memorable \"catchy\" songs and rewrites them with his own lyrics.  In addition, it is pretty amazing how he has \"most\" of his wardrobe changes on the stage.  It is pretty funny and extremely entertaining.Overall, the music, lyrics, jokes, and everything was fantastic.  After the show, I felt more relaxed and my headache was gone.  A true test of a show is whether you would return and PAY to see the show again.  My answer is yes. I give this a five star because it was great and it was FREE.  LOL....Enjoy!\n",

The meats offered at this small neighborhood market are fresh and quality. The price is affordable. . .for example this week my fiance and I dined on an amazing seasoned brisket for less then $5.00 each. The seasoning was perfect, the cooking instructions they provided when I asked worked without a single hitch, and the beef was tender and juicy even when well-done (which is how I like my meat cooked).They advertise their fresh Italian sausage (hot and sweet) - which is stocked new each Friday.  Also worth while is their ground beef (we easily go through a couple of lbs of ground beef a week between the two of us).  A slab of ribs will cook up tasty and tender on the grill, without needing to boil or marinade for hours. I have yet to try many of their other offerings - but I am sure I will at some point!Also check out the hot dog and hamburger buns - they are fresh and delicious!!The service is also friendly and helpful.  If I could adjust anything it would be the hours - they close at 5:00 each day and are not open on Sundays.  Thus, you have to make that effort to get their on Saturdays if you are not right near by in the neighborhood!\n",

From the deli men who hand you samples of meats and cheeses while you wait, to the great selection of bulk foods, to fine selection of meats to the Italian cheeses, to the fill-a-bottle- olive oil station to the fresh pasta to the bulk spices section to the moon and the sun and the earth and Jupiter, this place is lovely.  (Or loverly if your Eliza Dolittle).  The place tends to be packed like a tin of touch-a-philic sardines on the weekends, and I think many people are tourists, but that doesn't stop it from being great. And, that was a long sentence, but not as long as those of some really antiquated authors I've read.In any case, the Macaroni Company is a little slice of Italy mixed with Pittsburgherness and fun.\n",
            "Original: I will never buy any type of Italian sausage at Giant Eagle again because now i know what real sausage tastes like.  And, the deli counter guy at Giant Eagle doesn't inappropriately and amusingly call me \"babe\" every five seconds like the ones at Penn Mac do.   Ordering \"hot italian sausage\" from a deli guy that calls you \"babe\" is as amusing as Sunday morning can get.   :-)    I'll keep coming here for fresh meats and cheeses as long as I live in Pittsburgh.\n",

            "Original: I walked into Penn Macaroni Co knowing I knew absolutely nothing about cured meats and cheeses.  I've always been intimidated by specialty shops bc there are always giant lines with people who look impatient and want to just grab what they need and head out.  I decided to swallow up my fear and head inside with the intention of walking out knowing more than when I walked in.I headed to the cured meats section in the deli room and kinda just stood back staring at all the beautiful meats.  When one of the deli guys was free and asked me if I needed help, I flat out told him \"I know nothing about anything in this room.  But I want to learn.\"  And he was like \"I got just what you need\" and brought out some samples for me.  He went on to explain them to me and what kind of cheeses to pair with stuff.  After I picked out my meat, I was heading over to the cheese counter when he kinda called me out and was like \"I'm not done with you yet!\" and handed me butcher paper with even more cured meats and cheeses to try out.  He also told me I have to feed my friend more bc she looked too skinny, =P.I love going into a store where I get individualized attention by someone who actually cares about what he or she is doing and is passionate about his or her job.  It just makes you walk out with a smile on your face.I plan on heading back every other week to get a new pairing of meats and cheeses and hopefully one day my palate will be super sophisticated, haha\n",

John (part owner & tall, friendly guy behind the counter) will take time to talk with you about your wants & needs, and will special order anything you wish. I say this because he did it for me many times over the years that I lived walking distance from the store. Their fresh, Amish turkeys are the best you can get for Thanksgiving. You do need to order those in advance, however. If you don't see what you're looking for in the display case, just ask. He would custom cut a chunk of center sirloin for me - he always had a primal in stock, not frozen. He would let me hang out in the lobby and talk meat on Saturday mornings, between customers. I wanted to help out behind the counter, just to learn from the team, but they hire young people to work the counter, and I couldn't take a job as a hobby that someone else needed to get thru school, etc. Long story short - If you likelove meat, but can't tell a ribeye from a strip, this is the place to go. They will help you make a decision, and how to treat the meat if need be. Remember - the only stupid question is the one that never gets asked. You needn't worry that you will be looked down upon if you ask a novice grilling question. This is not a pretentious boutique. It's a friendly, helpful business that truly values your business, and they will help you make some killer meat!\n",

Anyway, just wanted to say that everyone raved about the food and we had lots of leftovers, ordered extra on purpose.

I have to admit as a child I was pretty unnerved by the ladies behind the counter but after 25+ years of going here, they are very sweet and wonderful ladies. Many times I have asked for suggestions and the have always came through for me. On my last trip I told them I am having a BBQ this weekend and what smoked sausage would go best as a snack.  Their question \"are you serving beer\", and yes I was! The next question \"you like spicy\" and yes i do.  She went over to the side wall and pulled two giant red links off the rack and said with a smile \"This...will be good.\" (when I got home I tried a little and It was good!)I can see where people can say the ladies behind the counter are intimidating but they really are wonderful.  I have stopped in for a sandwich a time or two in the afternoon and had great conversations with them when I was the only one in the store and it was slow.  They have even offered me a tour once.This is a place ran by hard working immigrants that have an amazing product. Every time I am in the area a make a point of stopping in and getting the smoked butt (the \"butt\" is actually the shoulder cut on a pig bot the actual butt). Its excellent sliced thin on a sandwich.You don't find sausage shops like this anymore.  My grandma grew up in Wisconsin and she said this place reminded her of the polish deli's she went to back in the 50's.  Authentic and yummy.\n",

I went home and chopped some up and sauteed it with some sliced fennel bulb and lentils and it was like wow, so good, both smoky and salty. I also picked up some sort of dried sausage stick and though it is bad for you, it is so good - a great addition to a nice glass of red wine, some cheese, and some good french bread.By the way, if you live in Tempe and go to the farmer's market on Saturday morning it is on your way home, just take 7th street to McDowell and take a right and it is right around 21st Street and McDowell.So, when you go in the store and the Eastern European women don't smile at you just remember, you walk in that store and you are in their culture, not yours, so enjoy the experience and buy some sausage! :-)\n",

Besides the tremendous brown bag lunch special, which consists of any dog or sausage with chips and a soda for $5, Schreiner's is a great place to buy loaf meat, weiners, and sausages.

It may look scarce when you walk in but most of the meat is kept in the back so just ask.  In addition to pastrami brisket you can get corned beef brisket, chicken, and assorted other deli meats.  They have have a grocer section where we were able to pick up challah rolls (mmm...challah french toast anyone), matzo meal for latkes and my husband's favorite pickles- Ba Tampte.  There are also lots of other selections ranging from candy to cous cous to egg flakes and cereals.  They have a pizza place next door (which may have deli offerings as well...) called King Solomon's but Segals itself is just a pure butcher and grocer.  Having grown up with kosher pizza we opted to not grab a slice because to be honest, kosher pizza isn't all that good.\n",

Then one of them (Nancy) noticed me standing there, turns around and says to me \"you're making a return you can get in the regular line.\" seriously did you really just suggest that your conversation is so much more critical than helping a customer that I should go wait in another line that's very interesting Nancy, thanks.

            "Translated: I went into this Michael's with two items to return. I noticed that there was only one cashier and a line 5 people deep, but luckily there was an employee behind the service desk. As I stood waiting to talk with her I realized the people she was talking to were not customers but two other employees, and the three of them were bitching about a customer who had wanted to make a return and how annoying she had been. Then one of them (Nancy) noticed me standing there, turns around and says to me \"you're making a return you can get in the regular line.\" seriously did you really just suggest that your conversation is so much more critical than helping a customer that I should go wait in another line that's very interesting Nancy, thanks. Meanwhile the other two don't even look at me, including the one manning the service desk. what the hell!I walk over to the one open register and wait for about 15 minutes while this one cashier works through all the people ahead of me. And I kid you not, when I was one person away from freedom, Nancy noticed that there were 3 people behind me, opened up a register and told the woman BEHIND ME to come over. Frankly I think all three of those employees should be fired for wasting Michael's and my time while getting paid. I'm sure they make crap pay but that is no excuse for flagrant laziness. It has cost Michael's my business.\n",

No matter what store I go into the employees are dull, unfriendly and lazy! They are always carrying on dumb conversations. The lines go on forever. The old lady cashiers are always rude like I'm wasting their time! There's always something on the wrong shelf so when you get to the cashier she looks at you like you're lying or just stupid!!! They have lost my business!!! Someone needs to get the District Manager in these stores because they wont stay in business with that customer service!!!\n",

If you quote a date, it needs to be available to be picked up that day or before in my opinion.  After speaking to the manager just now, he says they have \"125 customers that they deal with weekly in the framing dept.\"  uh-huh.  That's NOT that many customers for a big name store and if they can't get their s*** together by the day they say they will, then they better back it up with a phone call or in the future recommend a later day that the item should be finished and ready for pickup.  Total crap. Two thumbs DOWN, wayyyy DOWN.\n",

It's the only source of craft supplies that's handy while running errands in central Phoenix, and it's near one of the movie theaters that serves real food, so I shop here occasionally, and I always leave crabby.Every section is tiny and understocked. If something at another Michaels catches your eye, but you postpone buying it, and you figure, oh, you'll pick it up at this one because you're here... no, you won't. Wood trim, wood embellishments, specific acrylic paint colors, specific scrapbook paper designs, the edgiest floral items... forget it. This Michaels will not carry that. The staff will explain, with varying levels of chagrin, that \"this is the smallest Michaels in the region.\"That much is obvious. It's so small that it's impossible for two carts to pass in most aisles. The major reason to set foot in this store is that you're desperate for tacky glue and can't face the chaos of Walmart. It has so far not found an excuse to stop carrying tacky glue. There was also a moment of hope when the chain introduced Martha Stewart acrylic paints, which are at least interesting colors. But I'd really like to know whose bright idea it was that, chain-wide, acrylic paints should now be displayed entirely below knee level. Let me give you a hint, gentlemen: the tiny bottles of exotic colors are not bought by children. Nor is there a gigantic acrylic-painting movement among Munchkins. Your acrylic paint buyers are adults, which means we're mostly over 5 feet tall, and depending how the day went and how high of heels we're wearing, our urge to indulge in a series of deep knee bends can vary. A lot. But it's rarely a matter of: \"oh great! I'm going to Michaels so I can skip the squats at the gym!\"\n",

Never getting out of their seats at any point of our visit. (I've worked my way through collegelaw school doing retail, big no-no not greeting customers and making them feel un-welcomed).Soooo... I was mindlessly walking around the furniture portion of the store when.......GASSSSSPPPP! I tapped on some of the furniture with my finger nail!!! You would have though I had taken a hammer to it with their reaction. I was admiring their selection and not reading all the little signs about not touching anything. Whatever.I was annoyed with them not wanting me to touch anything but alas, its their store, if they don't want people to enjoy their products that's their business. What blew my top was when my boyfriend (who is very friendly and is always interested in what a business has to offer) asked them a question about a chair. An Egg Chair. You would have thought he sounded like a babbling idiot because their answers where so pretentious and condescending. He asked about other things they had in the store and they had the same cold attitude everyone else on here talks about.  Anyway, I'm assuming that the majority of the their actual customers come from web sales because there is no way anyone I know would spend that kind of money on furniture when the sales staff is acting like they're doing you a favor by allowing you to breath in their precious vintage air.\n",

            "Original: I was so excited to check out this store. Living in a vintage building and flush with cash, I felt it was the best prospect for furnishing my apartment. However after spending a few minutes in the store I felt cold, alienated and stupid,For starters I was never greeted, my presence acknowledged, or even asked how my day was. The store was empty upon my arrival, and it was not until I dared to touch an item that my presence was acknowledged....albeit with a condescending and rude outburst by the stores owner. I thought the furniture was vintage and original....apparently they refinish and refurbish furniture and pass it off as found vintage. I was told by the owner that most of e furniture was recently shellacked....and was not in display condition. I also had the unfortunate experience of asking the staff about several pieces I was interested in. Between eye rolls and deep sighs I was told of the inaccuracies in my question, yet never told if I could purchase the items or not. After being deemed too dumb to engage in a conversation by the woman minding the store I was handed over to the stores owner with a sigh, an eye roll, and a rather condescending \"do you want to handle this\". The stores owner than continued to alienate and insult me, making me feel dumb and rather small. It seems as though the storefront is a showroom for their online sales, as most items are not for sale...and anything that is worthwhile is plastered with \"do not touch\" signage. Very unhospitable for a furniture store, as I usually like to sit in something before I purchase it. I'm not going to even go into the prices, which seem as alienated from reality as the stores owner or his assistant; two ageing hipsters locked in a battle for who could be snootier or more pretentious. Aside from the nasty staff, the lack of  hospitality and the god-awfull smell inside the store I would say the store was acceptable. I'm sure this store will survive, as most online customers probably don't know that they are getting refurbished furniture stored in a putrid cat-urine smelling environment and sold by condescending belittling better-than-thou hipsters. ......avoid this store, check out the wonderful vintage stores elsewhere in town.\n",

They used have a location up in summerlin but moved down there when they couldn't pay the bills.To begin, the prices and policies are outrageous. Each hookah will average anywhere from $20-30 maybe more. This is pretty much double the price of most other lounges in town. For some reason, Red charges additional fees to mix flavors and its not cheap. Every additional flavor can tack another 2 bucks to each hookah. To accompany this overpriced hookah is of course overpriced drinks. And what weird drinks they have. Lounges like this that do no aspire to obtain a beer and wine license usually sell an assorments of drinks, teas, smoothies and the like. Red, however, feels compelled to offer non-alcoholic beers and non-alcoholic wines (yes they exisit). After seeing their drink selection, I wasn't sure if I should laugh or cry.Now keep in mind, I don't always mind paying more if its worth it, but this is definitely not the case at red. The hookah is absolutely dreadful. I don't think my words could describe the disaster that they bring to your table. The hookahs take forever to start and when they do get going, they taste like burnt tobacco. If your favorite flavors are charcoal and ash this definitely the place for you. The biggest culprit behind this atrocious mess is the lounge's insistence on using insta-light coals. They toss these coals on to the bowl and lock it under a metal funnel designed to contain the coal if the hookah falls over. On top that they actually demand an extra 5 bucks or so for a \"re-light.\" I was left speechless when I was actually asked to pay another 5 bucks for another coal.The atmosphere and lounge itself does nothing to redeem the hookahs here either. You will find CRT television sets displayed proudly around the lounge. I don't know why they keep the relics around. The place would be actually somewhat attractive if they got rid of them and opened the place up a bit. I have never seen it busy or even half-packed.There are plenty of great lounges in vegas, do yourself a favor and stay far far away from this place.\n",

The guy on the phone seemed very friendly and asked me what I would like to order and he could have it ready for pickup. I asked him if I could taste the chicken before ordering it and he said that would be fine. I am a new and very reluctant chicken eater in my quest to eat more protein so based on this info, I decided to head over to this place.The billing desk was swamped with several waitresses, and yet it took me a few minutes to request for someone's assistance and look at the menu. It took even longer to get someone to take my order.  The girl I spoke to, told me that they did not have sample options and I could not taste to see. I understood but told her about my phone convo few minutes ago with someone at their restaurant. She went to get an older lady who was possibly the manager or something, Mona. The woman told me that they could not me taste anything as they need to prepare big batches of food for each order seperately. Her tone seemed condescending and even though I was ready to walk out of the place, I decided to order the chicken na na as they told me it was good.The chicken na na was supposed to be a tender marinated chicken served with lettuce and tomato and house garlic sauce. I asked for the dish without the pita bread, to take out. Now, I may be wrong here but I think I read the price as 6.95 but the waitress charged 8.95 plus tax for this.The only thing worth mentioning in the dish was the garlic sauce in a yogurt base and it was pretty good. The chicken was dry with what seemed like herbs and spices thrown over. There was nothing tender about the chicken and I ended up taking a few bites and wasting the rest.Cannot comment on the ambience as I took my order to go. They could seriously benefit by having a few customer oriented staff members and improving the quality of food.Very dissapointed and will not return even if this is the only place food is available.\n",

            "Translated: If I had a chance I would rate this place as -1. Was on my way to another place but did not check the timings and the place was closed when I reached. Quickly searched for other mediterranean places nearby and called Olive to find out if the place was open. The guy on the phone seemed very friendly and asked me what I would like to order and he could have it ready for pickup. I asked him if I could taste the chicken before ordering it and he said that would be fine. I am a new and very reluctant chicken eater in my quest to eat more protein so based on this info, I decided to head over to this place.The billing desk was swamped with several waitresses, and yet it took me a few minutes to request for someone's assistance and look at the menu. It took even longer to get someone to take my order.  The girl I spoke to, told me that they did not have sample options and I could not taste to see.

            "Original: I'm going to start off by saying that this review is pretty much exclusively for the service. I have been here several times with my boyfriend (we have never had a service issue until now) and the hookah is always good, the drinks are so-so but reasonably priced and I absolutely LOVE the decor. However, after last night, I'm not sure I will ever patronize this place again. If I could give it 0 stars, I would. My boyfriend and I were meeting up with his uncle and friend who were already there. When we got there, we needed to be moved to a bigger table since they were sitting at a two seat one. It took us 5 minutes to get the waitress to come over, despite that there were only three other small groups in the place. When she did come over, she rolled her eyes and made a snarky comment about us moving table (the only thing we had was a hookah that needed to be moved...and she put us at the next table over so I would think that wouldn't be a big deal).After we moved, she disappeared for 20 minutes. When we were finally able to get drinks, she disappeared for another 45 minutes (this is not an exaggeration either). During the whole visit, this server made us feel like we were inconveniencing her by being in her breathing space when we asked her for anything. Her attitude made the whole group uncomfortable every time she would come over and, though we had intended to get some dinner as well while we were there, we finally got tired of being scared to ask her for anything so we just requested the bill. When we nicely asked her to split it (and I was being beyond patient at this point. I'm not someone who loses my temper with servers), she gave us a disgusted look and took an incredibly short, nasty tone with us but ultimately did it. This was, no embellishing, the worst and rudest service I have ever received in my life. My boyfriend and I were more than happy to leave and go across the street the Blue Fin, where they were more than happy to have our business.\n",

            "Original: I came here for a friends surprise birthday party. I arrived around 9 pm so it was pretty empty in the place. I was surprised at the size and amount of chairs they have to seat people. Very nice, dark layout. It could deem as a great place to chill and hang out with friends after a long day. However, the service here is a bit lacking. There were a lot of waitresses that night and they were huddling around the bar anticipating whether or not it'd be a busy night as I heard through their conversations. It was really dead and it was my first time there so I had no idea how it was on a busy night. I was really hungry while waiting for more people to arrive so I ordered a beef wrap and some hummus. Both weren't bad at all. I thought it was weird that the server took my card and opened up a tab for me as I was intentionally planning on not drinking that night, but I didn't say anything about it to her anyway. More people started arriving about an hour later and the lounge gradually started filling up as well. We had a whole row of seats and couches for our party, but as more people started showing up the servers started to get anxious as we were flowing out of the specific area they had for us. There were also several hookahs out. It seemed as if they didn't want all that business for them or couldn't handle that many people. They ended up making all of us get up and relocate into this bland side room which was away from all the music so it was a really weird atmosphere. It wasn't as comfortable as the lounge seating they had for typical guests, but they said we were taking up too much room out there apparently. We did not get much service in this room either. I understand it turned into a pretty busy night, but I think they could've used another waitress or two to staff our large party. When I finally received my tab at the end of the night, I noticed they double charged me on my bill. The waitress seemed a little upset about this even though it wasn't my fault claiming that someone else had charged me extra, not her, but she refunded me in cash so it was okay. The whole ordeal and events of the night made me feel like I never wanted to come back again. At least the people I was with made the night a little more enjoyable.\n",

Any good promoter will tell you that it is almost impossible to pack a place the size of a football field, that does not already have clientele in the first week and a half of promotion. We need to be cleaver and run several promotions and develop a crowd. Yet Hookah Palace was disappointed that we did not create a miracle. Hookah Palace decided to let us know when we accidentally called them that we would no longer be welcome there. This was on Tuesday, two days prior to the event, flyers were printed, invites were sent out, extra promoters were hires. We were also getting ready to set up our DJ battle which we discussed with Hookah Palace would run for five weeks. I guess we were lucky in that we did not start that up as soon as we would hope.

            "Original: Unfortunately still in pissy mood at going 0 for 3 in last new restaurant attempts.  Once again, a brief review filled with disappointment and regret.  Started with the Spanakopita, which was labelled as a Spinach Cheese Pie for $3.95.  It was cold.  What should have been flaky heavenly goodness in the form of phyllo dough was just greasy congealed torture, which was quite impressive with how this was so damn cold.  Maybe they should've left this in the microwave longer.  Blah.Entree that was recommended as their house specialty was their oven roasted lamb for $11.95.  It was halfway edible as the rice was sorta interesting with pine nuts for a nice crunch, but was a little dry.  And then the lamb.  It probably wouldn't be fair to say it was dry, it would be more fair to say it was Arizonan desert sand masquerading as meat.  Damnit, so disappointed again I can't even think of a witty way to end this review.  God bless the edit button, I'll have to come back with something.\n",

Started with the Spanakopita, which was labelled as a Spinach Cheese Pie for $3.95.  It was cold.  What should have been flaky heavenly goodness in the form of phyllo dough was just greasy congealed torture, which was quite impressive with how this was so damn cold.  Maybe they should've left this in the microwave longer.  Blah.Entree that was recommended as their house specialty was their oven roasted lamb for $11.95.  It was halfway edible as the rice was sorta interesting with pine nuts for a nice crunch, but was a little dry.  And then the lamb.  It probably wouldn't be fair to say it was dry, it would be more fair to say it was Arizonan desert sand masquerading as meat.  Damnit, so disappointed again I can't even think of a witty way to end this review.  God bless the edit button, I'll have to come back with something.\n",
            "Original: The owner was nice but very pushy on me ordering the specials. They didn't have what I wanted (grilled chicken burger) so I went with a falafel which seemed to upset him. My order came with soup, I chose lentil. That was very good. The falafel however was just not good at all. My tastebuds just could not agree with the sauce or ingredients.\n",

            "Original: This was the first Mediterranean place I had in AZ. I didn't feel like making dinner that night and was craving falafel, so I looked on Yelp and found the 4 star review, one of the highest and closest to me. The pictures looked authentic and delicious. I should've stayed home and saved my money. It's a hole in the wall, which I ordinarily like and can be a good indication of authenticity. The 1 star is for an attempt at a restaurant. The atmosphere and service wasn't bad. The falafel though -- worst I've ever had. It's dried out and flavorless. I judge a Mediterranean place on how good their falafel is, and this was terrible. I hardly wanted to finish it but did because I was hungry. The server -- I think he was the owner -- recommended a red wine, and I sprang for it. It was almost skunked, so he clearly pushed it on me to get rid of it. Gross.\n",

I had always heard that the owner was rude and finally saw it with my own eyes.Habib was taking our order. My mother asked if the fish was fresh and Habib said yes. My father asked again in the most polite words and soft spoken, friendly, respectful tone of voice if the fish was fresh or fresh frozen (my dad eats a lot of fish!) Habib SNAPPED back in a rude, confrontational and aggressive tone of voice and said \"I already answered you once! I do not need your business!\" I was frankly shocked. This was after my father had earlier paid him a compliment on his restaurant when we first got there. Frankly it ruined our mood, our meal and whole evening. My mother at this point preferred to leave but we were already there, settled in, tired from travel and we stayed and ate our food.The persian food here is reasonably good. Nothing spectacular but not disappointing. The prices are high for what is offered though. There are other places in town with better persian food (see reviews for Royal Persis and form your own opinion) but the physical location etc is not quite as nice, although my limited interactions with the owner there have been pretty pleasant. The inside of Habib's is more upscale, say, if you wanted to bring a guest from out of town, but frankly with an owner that can pop off at any moment does it really matter He can ruin any physical attributes the restaurant has with a few words.The other wait staff were pretty friendly. I think they may know that the owner acts the way he does and may try to make up for it (or are just trying to avoid pissing him off themselves).\n",

Habib said to my dad I'm the owner also management here and I won't allow you to sit there if you don't like it then leave.

I got up, words were exchanged and he ran to the front grabbing a phone and threatening to call the police.

            "Original: I took a party of 6 friends and co-workers there last week when attending a tradeshow in Vegas ... I will never do that again!Biggest issue:  The bill came and I noticed just about 30% added to the bill as \"tax\" ... yes, 30%!  When I asked the server about it, he said that that includes 18% as service fee and 8.1% as tax ... and that that is explained in the menu.  I have several issues with this:1. Shame on me for not reading the menu and the fine print ... my mistake, but if you are reading this review, you don't have to make this mistake.2. Why am I forced to leave an 18% tip  The tip is not at my discretion.  If the server is not helpful, I can't express myself in any way.  3. Why is listed as \"tax\"  I bet you most people do not even see it and add tip on top of it automatically!!!  That is stealing!4. Now, it gets worse:  I asked the server that if there is an 18% service fee plus an 8.1% tax, that adds up to 26.1%.  So, why is there an almost 30% charge  They add 8.1% to the bill and then they add 18% tip on top of it.  So, the effective percentage for tip is higher than 18%.Food:  It was no special in any way.  I am very familiar with Persian food.  I have had it in many cities and many countries.  I look for Persian restaurants everywhere I go.  This restaurant is not bad but it is not good either.  The food in NO WAY justifies the prices they charge!  I had chicken with bones, and it was not cooked well.  For appetizer, we had tadig which the crispy rice that is cooked in the bottom of the pan, and we had it with two kinds of stew.  Tadig was good but not enough for 6 people.  Stews were OK, but again not special.Service:  It was OK.  The server was not really pleasant: smiling or welcoming.  He was not rude or anything, but I felt like we were bothering him being there.  And the place was not busy.  The service in NO WAY justified more than 18% in tip.  But think about it the guy didn't care because he knew he will get his tip any way.  I will not recommend this place:  not for food, not for service and not for being overcharged!\n",

Maybe if someone had been doing their job, they wouldn't be surprised to find hungry people in a restaurant.She came to our table, got our drinks (a soda and a water) and asked us if we were ready to order. When we said no she said she would be back. We could see her chit chatting with another server, but again, couldn't get her attention to come back to take our order.

Let me state that my wife made me go here tonight because my friends wanted to and she said I need to indulge their interests. Even if they suck. Buffalo Blues is like a Hooters, except the girls where more clothes and are not as good looking. The service is horrendous and the food may be better at Hooters.  The beer selection is decent at Buffalo Blues but it is expensive and they often run out of things that are still on the board.My friends like going for all you can eat wing night but frankly I don't get it. You get 10 wings up front they will give more wings 5 at a time. The problem is that you get those wings in 30 minute intervals.  So the max you could eat is 55 wings. Did I mention that  the wings are really tiny and the sauce is tossed on like a Jackson Pollack painting.  They also charge extra for blue cheese or ranch.  The wings do not come with celery. This is a crime against humanity and the city of Buffalo.  I chose to detour from wings tonight and ordered a chicken sandwich. Apparently this was a bad choice.  It took a full hour to get my food. It was so long that the rest of the table ate their wings and ordered more and the waitress didn't think this was a problem. When my meal did arrive everything was cold. The sandwich was ok, but the fries were just tiny pieces that were limp and flavorless.I paid $16 for a beer and a sandwich that my friends had to wait for me to eat to leave.  I would say I won't go back, but apparently I like my friends more than I like good food and service.\n",

            "Original: Unfortunately, the service we were given ruined our overall experience at Buffalo Blues. We sat down and put in our drink order.  My husband was excited about the amount of beers they had on tap. Fifteen minutes later and still without drinks, we saw our server trying to hunt the bartender down. Once the bartender finally started working on our drinks, she realized the keg for the beer my husband ordered was tapped. We were sitting at the booths right next to the bar but instead of the bartender just telling us so we could make another decision and get our drinks as soon as possible, she waited for the waitress to come back to tell her. Then, the waitress came back and did not apologize at all but simply said that he had to pick a different beer because they were out of that one. Anyway, long story short, it took way too long to get drinks and there was never any recognition from the staff of the issue. The restaurant seemed poorly managed and subpar. We will not be back.\n",

First clue:  no Happy Hour promos mentioned in the bar except for the Yeungs and Wings (which was not what we were looking for).  We came close to leaving as my beer was off the draft list, but we decided to stay and were disappointed that my daughter's choice was already gone although still ilsted.  The food was awful, the service worse.  Maybe a busser should clean the table after removing the dirty dishes--our table was a sticky  mess.  The service:  one beer to the table at a time.  Next round I saw two beers go to a three-top, removed and sent to the bar, poured out and the glasses refilled and brought to us.  Someone else's food was brought to our table, our fries came out --lukewarm---but our wing order never went in.  So we got our garlic parm wings which tasted like old overcooked chicken and was way too crispy and greasy for my taste.  We ate two each, then told the server we didn't want them.  She offered to take them off, but we told her that wasn't necessary, so they took off 12 the price as a Customer service gesture.  Still, we had a Happy Hour bill for 12 eaten fries, barely touched wings, and 6 drafts total of $45 at a dirty table.  At least the place was quiet--there were empty tables everywhere.  I think we're done here.\n",

It also is DNC week and parking is off limits except for a few places along the street. Luckily we found one after circling 4 times. We walked in and it was awkward. One of those moments that you see in movies where a bar is noisy everyone stops and stares then goes about their business. Normally this isn't an issue but when the waitress and bartender does this its....awkward. We found a booth and sat and waited to be greeted. We waited, looked around and waited some more.

Wasn't sure if we should have sat at the bar to be noticed, or like in elementary school raise our hands to have permission to speak. It would have probably made a difference to recieve a smile or simple hello from the person behind the bar, then we probably wouldn't have felt forgotten. After 14 minutes we finally met our waitress who asked us if we needed more time to review the menu. Really We counted 3 parties, thats it...in a otherwise bare restaurant. Food was good, received it pretty quickly. Our drinks were refilled often without being asked. First impressions really do matter. It wouldn't have mattered from that point if service was perfect.

We only got offered one round of drinks, never asked if we wanted a second round.  We had to ask for our silverwarenapkins after our food came, and did not get it until at least 10 minutes later about halfway through the meal. All the while watching the group of guys next to us get service repeatedly (when they asked her to get something, she would immediately come back to their table, not disappear for 10 minutes then have to be asked again when she did finally return). Aside from just being terrible, she was also unfriendly.  As for the food, all my friends seemed to enjoyappreciate their meals.  For about 8-10$, you get a huge sandwichburger and a side of fries.  Except $8 for a basket of chip and cheese dip is ridiculously overpriced to me.As a vegetarian, it was entirely another matter for me.  Not wanting a \"veggie\" burger, I ordered the buffalo blue cheese dip + potato wedgeschips + vegetables off the appetizer menu.  What was delivered was a basket of chips and cheese dip. When I asked the waitress if I was correct that the menu listed vegetables as well, she said \"yeah, it should come with it\" as if I was asking too much for the kitchen to produce what the menu says.  It wasn't actually until I explained the vegetable part was the reason I ordered this dish that she \"offered\" to get them for me.  She disappears. Ten minutes later, my friends halfway through their meal, no vegetables in sight, but at least we have silverware and napkins now.  Five minutes later, she hears us loudly complaining, and says shes told the kitchen twice now.. yeah right. Another ten minutes later, we're complaining real loud now, to ourselves because no staff member is in sight.  Soon the manager appears and says the vegetables will be out soon and apologizes.  My cheese dip and potato chips are not semi-warm, at best. He returns, and in a pretentiously apologetic manner sets done a plate and gets ready to scurry off before I can complain about: THREE 6-inch cuts of celery, and TWO 4-inch by 1-inch hunks of a carrot, completely RAW.  It took them 25 minutes to bring this out to me, and then act as if this would suffice without any compensation.  We immediately asked for a box and a discount. Yes, he discounted us 10% of our final bill, which I think came out to deducting my cheese dip and chips, plus half of my beer.  The waitress brought it out as one check too, not asking if us 2 men and 2 women (obviously 2 couples), would have wanted the check split.The kicker: the sidewalk sign outside their door read \"Charlotte's Finest\" ... Methinks not.\n",

All the while watching the group of guys next to us get service repeatedly (when they asked her to get something, she would immediately come back to their table, not disappear for 10 minutes then have to be asked again when she did finally return). Aside from just being terrible, she was also unfriendly.  As for the food, all my friends seemed to enjoyappreciate their meals.  For about 8-10$, you get a huge sandwichburger and a side of fries.  Except $8 for a basket of chip and cheese dip is ridiculously overpriced to me.As a vegetarian, it was entirely another matter for me.  Not wanting a \"veggie\" burger, I ordered the buffalo blue cheese dip + potato wedgeschips + vegetables off the appetizer menu.  What was delivered was a basket of chips and cheese dip. When I asked the waitress if I was correct that the menu listed vegetables as well, she said \"yeah, it should come with it\" as if I was asking too much for the kitchen to produce what the menu says.  It wasn't actually until I explained the vegetable part was the reason I ordered this dish that she \"offered\" to get them for me.  She disappears. Ten minutes later, my friends halfway through their meal, no vegetables in sight, but at least we have silverware and napkins now.  Five minutes later, she hears us loudly complaining, and says shes told the kitchen twice now.. yeah right. Another ten minutes later, we're complaining real loud now, to ourselves because no staff member is in sight.  Soon the manager appears and says the vegetables will be out soon and apologizes.  My cheese dip and potato chips are not semi-warm, at best. He returns, and in a pretentiously apologetic manner sets done a plate and gets ready to scurry off before I can complain about: THREE 6-inch cuts of celery, and TWO 4-inch by 1-inch hunks of a carrot, completely RAW.  It took them 25 minutes to bring this out to me, and then act as if this would suffice without any compensation.  We immediately asked for a box and a discount. Yes, he discounted us 10% of our final bill, which I think came out to deducting my cheese dip and chips, plus half of my beer.  The waitress brought it out as one check too, not asking if us 2 men and 2 women (obviously 2 couples), would have wanted the check split.The kicker: the sidewalk sign outside their door read \"Charlotte's Finest\" ... Methinks not.\n",

I don't see how anybody could learn to dance there. The quality of instruction isn't close to other local studios I have been to. Of course maybe the instruction was better than I knew since it was almost impossible to see or hear the instructor and individual attention is out of the question. I gave them another try on a Thursday for a West Coast Swing lesson. The quality of instruction wasn't good, and we had distractions because other group lessons and privates were given in the same ballroom. They have other small ballrooms so there was little excuse to cram everybody into the main ballroom. I watched a private lesson and wasn't impressed by what I saw. Paragon is probably popular because of the dances after the lessons but the music wasn't for beginners. So, if you want to learn dancing go somewhere else, for meat markets do Paragon.

Especially the way that push-cart servers call out the food which make you feel like you're in a rowdy tourist market full of cheap knock-offs they're trying to get rid of.  But all would have been forgiven if only the dim-sum being served was any good.  However the dishes we ordered reflected a sloppy kitchen that was focused solely on putting in minimal effort and taking every possible shortcut on the food. Dishes that made me ashamed to be Chinese (yes, the level that C-Fu dimsum brought it down to was that bad):-  Fried glutinous rice:  The preserved meat that was supposed to flavor the dish was MIA. We complained to one of the waiters who replied that \"they probably forgot\" (um are you sure it's not cost cutting for those who don't know any better).  More over, the proper way to cook this classic dish would be like risotto where you're constantly stirring and gradually adding water just a little bit at a time (except of course everything is being done in a wok)...Here the C-Fu kitchen obviously just shoved the whole thing into an electric rice-cooker and try to stir fry the huge sticky mess at the end by adding in gallons of oil.   -  Glutinous rice with chicken steamed in lotus leaf:  Once again that electric rice cooker in the back of the kitchen must be working real hard cause the dish lacked the aroma that it would have had if it had actually been steamed in lotus leaf.  Just tasted of sloppy topping of minced chicken and last minute wrapping in the lotus leaf.Dishes I was amazed by (and no not in a good way):-  Deep fried taro dumpling:  Have never quite had it in that simplistic way before where the filling literally was just mashed taro held together by a prodigious amount of oil-  Steamed bok choy:  How the heck do you get oil into steamed vegetable  C-Fu managed to accomplish this amazing feat of greasy steamed vegetable...unbelievableOn a good note, the Siu Mai was decent.  We did keep on ordering more dishes hopping that something good would pop up...but nope that was it,...so if  you must go to C-Fu for dim-sum...just order order a lot of siu mai and be careful of all the other dishes.  Dinner here was much better. 1 star is for dim-sum only.Next time I have a dim-sum craving, you'll be finding me across the valley at China Chan's (Glendale) where the short & sweet dimsum offering is cooked by a man who doesn't cut corners and it shows.

I was hungry and craving chinese, so why not I figured.Called in to see if they were open and they were, but hearing that they had an hour wait, I elected to carry out.  15-20 minutes is about average so I didn't say boo.  25 minute prep time isn't too far outside of the estimate and they were busy after all.The barbecue pork lo-mein was not the best ever.  Pork had a fatty texture, and the dish as a whole was okay though a bit bland.  The duck won ton soup was pretty good....Right until I got to the meat.  Almost every piece had either bones or bone chips in it.  I am not sure if that is a normal part of how it's made, but I have never experienced the like before and it was a put off.The experience over the phone and waiting was fair.  The place was packed due to being one of the rare places open Christmas night  and I understand the pressure of being a host or hostess in this situation, but I saw this girl loose her composure a few times in the 15 minutes I was there, once pretty majorly.With the bones, fatty flavor and other worries, I managed a few bites overall before my $20 meal went into the garbage disposal or trash.  I'm stunned with the overwhelming good reviews, as my experience was so weak as I had pretty much a poor experience overall and a lot of disappointment.I may or may not give them another shot in the future.

I was hungry and craving chinese, so why not I figured.Called in to see if they were open and they were, but hearing that they had an hour wait, I elected to carry out.  15-20 minutes is about average so I didn't say boo.  25 minute prep time isn't too far outside of the estimate and they were busy after all.The barbecue pork lo-mein was not the best ever.  Pork had a fatty texture, and the dish as a whole was okay though a bit bland.  The duck won ton soup was pretty good....Right until I got to the meat.  Almost every piece had either bones or bone chips in it.  I am not sure if that is a normal part of how it's made, but I have never experienced the like before and it was a put off.The experience over the phone and waiting was fair.  The place was packed due to being one of the rare places open Christmas night  and I understand the pressure of being a host or hostess in this situation, but I saw this girl loose her composure a few times in the 15 minutes I was there, once pretty majorly.With the bones, fatty flavor and other worries, I managed a few bites overall before my $20 meal went into the garbage disposal or trash.  I'm stunned with the overwhelming good reviews, as my experience was so weak as I had pretty much a poor experience overall and a lot of disappointment.I may or may not give them another shot in the future.  At the moment, I doubt it.\n",

So, it's a good thing that she acknowledged.  Ok, so we thought it was over.  I go up to their fresh vegetable stir-fry area where the guy does it in front of you.

Is it booby trap day for us  I took it to the guy and he said it's from the bean sprouts...I said no, it's not and I actually picked it up with my fork and showed him.  He didn't apologize but asks me if I wanted another one...I don't think so! After all this happened, we kind of lost our appetite but we paid $50 for our freaking dinner!  So we were just careful of what we were putting in our mouth, sigh...  While we were having dinner, my son had to go to restroom so hubby took him. While they were in there, one of the workers came in to use the restroom, he went pee, and blew his nose in his hands and just rinsed his finger tips off and left...that is freaking GROSS!!!!!

This place definitely deserves its 3 stars; however I just had the worst experience after years of eating here. I'm not entirely sure if the management has changed throughout the years, but whoever hired these waiters and the grill master must not have taken their applications seriously. My first bad experience happened the second I was seated. The waiter rolled his eyes at my party members for taking a little while on deciding what they wanted to drink. He was paying so little attention to us that he even got 2 out of 6 drinks wrong.Second, I remembered how much I used to love making my own Mongolian barbeque because of how friendly the old grill master used to be... however, not quite this time. I had to call him twice just to get his attention and he definitely ignored me both times because after the third time I asked him to make my order spicy, he told me to go and grab the sauce myself. Sorry grill master, but no tip for you this time.Lastly, the same waiter that made a fuss about getting my drinks was taking my plates away. This time, this guy manages to spill all the pot sticker sauce all over my table and on my girlfriend's seat while she was gone. The guy never apologized and just simply up and left our table in a mess.Needless to say I didn't tip these bastards one cent for their horrid service. I would've been better off getting my own drink and making my own barbeque.

All the other times I've been here, nothing worth mentioning, but the most recent time will be my last time.Now I don't know who all the titles of the staff, so I'll just refer to them as waiters and busers. I think we had 2 servers and 2-3 busers throughout the course of our meal.2-3 because I think I saw two busers that looks identical, and I'm not being racist because I'm Chinese myself, so I'll just count them both as one person.We first get there and put in our order. I didn't keep track of time, but probably after 20-30 minutes we get our appetizer, still no soup though and that's supposed to come first.  Buser 1 delivers the appetizer but practically drops the dish on the table with a loud thud and immediately walks away. About 10-20 minutes later the other dishes started coming. The worst dish was the sizzling pepper steak. The thing about this dish is when it comes to your table, the steak is supposed to be sizzling in the metal tray. In our case, it came out at room temperature (meat and metal pan), so as you can expect, absolutely no sizzle.Sometime throughout the meal, we asked Buser 1 if we're supposed to get soup. He responds by saying don't ask him, ask the waiter. So we ask one of the waiters and he apologizes and says he'll get us soup. About 10 minutes later, we still haven't received the soup so we don't really bother anymore. The waiter walks by and asks if we have received our soup yet, which we said not yet, and he could tell by the lack of soup bowls. He immediately gets someone (again) to bring out soup. This time, Buser 2, puts the bowl of soup down, not sure where his mind is at, but drops the soup spoon into the bowl and splashes all of us with soup, my mom suffering the most splash damage. He says sorry once, but for an incident like that, I think you should be more apologetic.After a few more dishes arrive, we ask for rice, which is not something that you should need to do yourself at a Chinese restaurant.Finally when we're done eating, we ask Buser 1 for some to-go boxes. He goes and brings back boxes and before he walks away says \"Ask someone else to do it\". WTF kind of attitude is thatIn the end, they had the audacity to charge us 18% gratuity on a party of 4 with dreadful service. Overall the food was decent, but it was PAINFUL to eat with that degree of service.\n",

            "Original: Much different experience the second time around. The second time reveals a disturbing issue. Well this is absolutely disappointing to write. Especially after writing a favorable review of Great Wall the first time around. But our experience here was not good during our last visit.First, we were not acknowledged when we came in the door. We had to pardon an employee (who appeared to be doing nothing) to take us in. He then proceeded to take us to a booth after we requested a table and chairs. We asked again to be seated at a table and chairs and he finally obliged. We were given menus and that's when the real trouble began in terms of service. First, we ordered a lot of food. 2 main dishes, 2 appetizers, 2 drinks, and an extra side dish to split. It was my last night in Phoenix so I wanted to go all out and sample some different things. Besides, we have the money so who cares right Well, the drinks came and when we ordered the server let us know there were no BBQ pork ribs, but didn't offer an alternative. When I picked something else, he rolled his eyes and said \"So you really want pork\". Yes. I do. So we waited for our appetizers, only one of which came out before the main dishes. The others came out with the dinners. Now the food was good, I have no complaints there. But when the person bringing us the food came out, she would't even look at us. The feeling I was getting was that they were either disgusted with our presence or just didn't care to talk to their non-Asian customers. I say that because the servers were \"chatting up\" the Chinese folks at their tables (it wasn't a busy night only a few small families), but they were literally ignoring us and a hispanic family sitting adjacent to us. I wouldn't normally write about that but it was so egregious I have to say how it appeared to look. I wish I could say it had something to do with language barriers and being comfortable with your native tongue maybe, but they spoke English fine from what I saw and it just didn't feel good to be ignored. Anyway, no refills on tea, water, or our main drinks were given. When we were done, we were ignored for 20 minutes until I glared at another server who was having banter with an Asian couple near us. I guess he told our server to bring us a check. So we pull out the Amex and what do you know For the first time all night our server immediately comes over and says in perfect English \"we don't take American Express\" (even though the tray the bill was on says \"Amex Preferred\", but that's neither here nor there.Wow. Once it was time to pay, he's on my shoulder like a parrot. Prior to that, he wanted nothing to do with us. Finally, the woman who came out to put the food in 'to-go' bags literally ignored us even after I smiled and tried to talk to her. She turned her head away when my date tried to thank her for putting everything in bags for us. And our sending off Waiting another 10 minutes for someone to come take the card before giving up and walking to front and giving the bill to someone who appeared to be a manager. No tip given. You've got to be kidding me. In the end this experience wrecked what was supposed to be my new Chinese food place. The service ruined what was great food. The feeling I got while there was that they didn't particularly care if we (non-Chinese customers) were there. And that is really sad. Needless to say, we won't be coming back.\n",

We were planning a trip to Vegas and figured that we would try something different, as opposed to the usual buffets that we would normally head straight for. Innocently enough, we made a B-Line straight to Chang's once we arrived in Vegas and was anticipating a decent Dim Sum experience. Once we got there, we were left standing in the Foyer for a few minutes. During this time, I noticed that one of the servers arrived late from behind us and hadn't had the chance to clock in before she sat us. I just found that kinda funny and thought I would share this with you! =) As the Brunch progressed, the wife got really tiffed because the best Chinese team, in terms of timing and follow-through, in the Dim Sum industry decided that they would all take the day off and allow the lack-luster, slow, and incompetent crew work a solid day. Whoa is me! Service was slow, our tea order was really late, the food was sub-par, and most of all, my hot chili sauce was late! I loves me some hot chili sauce with my Dim Sum dumplins!I think that the highlight of our experience was when my wife finally threw in the towel and flagged down a Chinese lady and berated her with God knows what! I couldn't tell you what she said but service surely improved from that point on! God I love feisty Chinese women! The Dim Sum itself was not memorable and the chicken feet were like the worst things because it tasted breaded before braising.  It felt and tasted gummy.  The prices were great and its location was easy to find! It wasn't tucked in the corner of some sleezy shopping plaza that may be impossible to get into or out--to! The final note from me is that, all in all, I will not go out of my way to come back here. I think the only way I would is if a friend clocked me over the head with a baseball bat (preferably metal..my head might shatter a wooden one then I'll be left cleaning the bits of splintered wood from the carpet with a headache! Who wants that!) and bribe the paramedics to drop us off here rather than the Hospital. Maybe this way I wouldn't mind the mediocre tasting food, but I'd probably bleed out before I get my chili sauce! =(\n",

I said, \"there are only 6 adults and 4 children.\" He (I believe the owner) just shrouded his shoulders and said, \"that's our service charge.\" $19.25!!!! - that's an extreme charge for servicing water refills and collecting empty dim sum containers.

            "Original: So, obviously, I'm one of those people who doesn't learn from their mistakes.  This time, instead of going into the restaurant for dim sum, we ordered Chinese takeout.  The soups were meh.  Neither the wonton nor the hot and sour soup had much flavor.  Next came the entrees.  For our family dinner night, we ordered Sesame Chicken, Orange Chicken, and Sweet & Sour Chicken entrees.  Neither of the kids cared much for the Sweet & Sour Chicken.  They said it \"tasted funny.\"  They didn't even want to put on the sweet, sticky red sauce that came in a big container on the side.  And what kid doesn't love that  That's never been an issue before.  My partner had the Orange Chicken which looked and tasted like chicken covered in the exact same red sweet & sour sauce.  He, too, was not thrilled.  Mine was the Sesame Chicken.  It, too, came in what looked like the EXACT SAME red sweet & sour sauce with a few (a very few) sesame seeds sprinkled on top.  I've never had Sesame Chicken that wasn't in a flavorful BROWN sauce and covered in sesame seeds.  Mine, too, was practically flavorless.  The accompanying rice they gave us was pretty dry and sticky.  Lastly, there were no fortune cookies to finish off a below-average meal.  To top it all off, the restaurant had apparently significantly raised the prices on everything since the last take-out menu we had on hand.  So, when picking up the order, we paid more than expected and the quality was practically non-existent.  Dim Sum is OFF our list FOREVER for both take-out and dine-in.  As our once-president once said, \"Fool me once, shame on ... shame on you. Fool me... You can't get fooled again.\"\n",

            "Original: I think I made a terrible mistake and ordered Americanized -Chinese food from a Dim Sum Restaurant.  We ordered two extra-crispy General Tso's Chicken with added rice (one white, one fried) and an egg roll. They do not serve combos here so our two entrees came to about $23. There was a lot of food - but it was a little pricier than some of the other fast food Chinese take-out places. I don't mind paying extra if it's tasty- and it really wasn't that much more in terms of price. It was hands down the worst Chinese I have ever tasted. The rice had a rancid flavor - it smelled and tasted quite bad so my husband graciously offered his white rice to me. The base of fried rice is white rice so I doubt it was the rice itself but whatever they put in it was not appetizing. The chicken was soggy, sugary-sweet (tasted like a very spicey sweet and sour sauce, it was even bright red in color) ...it didn't taste like any General Tso's I have tasted before. I barely ate my dinner and because it was take-out I wasn't able to give management a chance to fix it unfortunately. There were a couple of highlights ...the staff went the extra step to attempt to keep the crispy texture and did not sauce the chicken until we picked up our dinners, which was very thoughtful of her. They also have a really delicious homemade eggroll. It was oily but you know what it had actual meat and veggies inside of it and that made me happy. Overall I just can't bring myself to come back for take-out, but I was told the Dim Sum on Sundays is delicious so I may give that a shot in six months once I forget about that rice that will haunt my dreams.\n",

            "Original: This place has become really BAD since the owners changed recently. The dim sum beef which used to be great has become rubbery and the pork has lost all its flavor. We used to enjoy this place before, but now on a recent weekend visit we saw only about a quarter of the tables occupied. After the dim sum lunch, we figured out why. The dirty place and rude waitresses were tolerable because of the good food... not anymore when cold tough meat is served.\n",

            "Original: One of the most aggravating restaurants I have been to in awhile. My partner and I were so irritated that we both got into an argument we were so irritated.First arrive and there is a woman sitting behind the front counter and she does not greet us right away so we are standing there awkwardly not sure of what to do, my partner asks, \"are we supposed to sit ourselves\" to me. Then she finally greeted us and we were whisked away to a huge table for only the two of us. All of the colors are bright in here which didn't bother me the same way they seem to bother everyone else.We were given a very short menu with half in Chinese but then after awhile I see another couple with a very extensive menu and I am left wondering wth I checked online before I went and saw that they had vegetarian options which I did not see on this extremely short menu. The other couple was white and we are not so it was not like they got the better all Chinese menu because they were Asian or something. When the owner comes to the table we request the other menu which he was happy to oblige. There were so many options you could get lost in that menu but I liked it.We ordered a half duck, and vegetables in oyster sauce with jasmine tea. The duck came for some reason 10 minutes before my meal did so we both had to sit there waiting for my food because my partner did not want to eat without me. No Jasmine tea had come by that time 25 minutes after ordering. The duck was greasy and cold as my partner described it; it was like if someone had cooked it earlier in the day and left it out, room temperature and old tasting. When they finally came with my meal I found that the 'vegetables' was really only bok choy in some oyster sauce, I was very unhappy and the bok choy they gave me was mostly stems. We had to remind the original waiter to bring our tea and we ordered some spring rolls at that time.The tea finally came and my partner asked for a spoon for the rice and that took 5 minutes to bring that, I even think that was yet another waiter who came to the table. My partner asked if they could warm up the duck which they did. Service was sooo slow even though there were many workers. The spring rolls we ordered never came so in disgust we just had our meals boxed and walked up to the counter to pay rather than wait 20 minutes to pay a check at the table. We will get our roasted duck from Lee Lee's from now on.\n",

My best instinct tells me I shouldn't have bothered, but I gave it a whirl, and... The food wasn't *horrible*. The fried rice was really bland. The Egg Drop Soup was kinda barfy. It had nasty peas corn and carrots, and the vegetables had been dehydrated.. they weren't dehydrated very well. My entree was General Tso's Chicken. It was certainly the highlight of the experience, but the chicken itself seemed oddly dense, and of low quality. The prices weren't super great either. I'm guessing all the hype is about the Dim Sum, and the more exotic seafood offerings. I'm still in disbelief that they would not accept the check-in special, filth factor makes me wonder what kind of public health hazard China King is.\n",

I tried mentioning other options like Noodle Palace, KFC, or even cyanide...but I didn't want to be rude to the birthday girl so off we went. 1st Impression: It's 2pm on a Friday...this is SO not the time to go for dim sum. 2nd Impression: Overflowing trashcan as soon as you walk in. ***getting nauseous*** 3rd Impression: The smell of rancid oil. ***Mental note not to eat anything fried and getting more nauseous*** 4th Impression: I bit down into a COLD piece of siu mai. ***Thinking happy thoughts to hold back chunks***5th Impression: 'Why aren't we leaving', I think to myself as we proceed to order MORE food. 6th Impression: 12 the food that we order is cold and we are forced to ask the cart lady to get us hotter trays from the bottom of the cart ***Thinking about where I can locate and Epipen and wondering why we're still there*** In summary: This is one of the nastiest dim sum places I have EVER encountered. As I predicted, all day dim sum means a lot of their stuff is frozen and machine made (e.g. har gao, char siu bao, etc.). If you have no idea what good dim sum tastes like, don't like yourself very much, or are in a state where euthanasia is illegal then come on in. Otherwise, avoid like the plague.\n",
            "Original: This place used to be good...we've been going for a few years. We overlooked that it was dirty because the food was cheap and good. We're Chinese and sadly expect a lot of good Chinese food places to be on the dirty side. Over the past 6 months, we've had really bad food experiences.We kept going back hoping it was going to get better again or maybe the last time was a bad fluke. After 5 more of these bad experiences, we knew we won't be going back even though it was the only place we knew that had 24hr dim sum. The service is typical rude Chinese, and I'm Chinese. Sometimes the dim sum is spoiled tasting. Recently they kept raised the prices of the dim sum and they will stamp a higher priced letter than what is listed on the menu. We never complained when we first saw them stamping higher priced dim sum items when it should have been the lowest priced item because we didn't want to be the \"complainers\". It's also a totally different price than what they advertise on the sign outside.  Thank goodness my mom knows her math, cuz I just pay a bill when I get it. Well they over charged us by $35 recently and had the nerve to argue with us about it. When we forced them to re-add, they never apologized or admitted to any wrong doing. They corrected the amount, put it on the table and walked away. We definitely will never return and suggest that the people who do go, keep a watchful eye on the dim sum stamp as well as add up your own bill. And if it tastes wierd, it's probably spoiled because they have all day dim sum and the crap may have been sitting out all day.\n",

            "Original: Despite how hard I rate businesses, its actually rare for me to give a 1 star. Its like a restaurant has to try to get a 1 star review from me.I came here around 12:15 waiting for my the others in my party. When they arrived, it was around 1pm. We got seated, and I swear someone released a stink bomb in the room or something, the entire place turned into a ghost town. Calamari - I ate it. it was cold. Was I in a sushi restaurant, not a dim sum restaurant Nope. Just horrible. Shrimp Dumplings - One of the orders, the skin fell apart. The other the shrimp was all mushy, as if it has been nuked in the microwave.  Pork Dumplings - Cold and mushy. Same texture as the shrimp dumplings.  Sesame Balls - Oily, cold, goopy item. Once this gets cold, it just gross. Jook - They ran out by 1PM. Blah.There were more items, but I guess they weren't good enough for me to remember the dishes. Some of you may be saying, show up earlier or go during prime time dim sum time. Yup, I'm fully aware of that. But what kind of establishment goes from good to suckage for the changeover to regular lunch If a restaurant lets me order it, I can review it as is. This just shows poor quality control on their part, willing to sacrifice their name to earn a couple of bucks for disappointing dim sum. Either keep up the quality or don't serve dim sum after a certain time.I'll be willing to give this place another chance and I'll come during prime time, but I can't see the score improving that much. Until then, stay out of this place after 1pm.\n",

            "Original: I've been here several times with family since I was a kid. The service is like many of the Chinese restaurants in Vegas. BAD! Which is fine, since I'm used to it by now, but my last experience here made me never want to come back.I decided to come here one day craving Dim Sum. It was the closest location to my school so I decided to pay Orchid Garden a visit. I went in, glad to see there was no line, made I contact with at least 3 different people and had to wait 10 minutes before I was seated. I understand if it is not your job as a cart pusher to seat customers, but I'm sure you have the ability to sit me down at a table or at least notify the host to seat me.Once I was seated, I wanted ordered my usual Har Gow, Siu Mai, Chow Fun, and Shrimp balls; however, after being served cold shrimp balls and Siu Mai, I couldn't eat any more of the food they were serving. The 5 waitresses running around the restaurant didn't ever have time to check and ask if \"everything is okay\" or if there's \"anything I need..\" So I helped myself and my girlfriend to the counter, asked for the check, left no tip and walked out.I highly recommend eating at Cathay or Chang's for Dim Sum. They are alot friendlier and the food is much better.\n",

When they finally opened we got seated right away but service was VERY slow as there was only ONE CHART walking around to serve 12+ tables with families waiting for some dim sum. I don't know why it's so packed but it must be good right .....WRONG!!! .....When the lady finally came up to us there wasn't a lot of selection to choose from and the usual items that we get back home weren't that good at all.

I also had problems with the individual TVs on machines; sometimes they wouldn't work properly or would be completely broken.The gym was generally quiet enough in the mornings, but it would be pretty packed after work. It was hard to find a machine. The staff also didn't really enforce the 30 min time-limit policy, which caused people to have to wait for equipment longer than necessary.I was told on the phone I needed to let them know before the 25th of a given month to cancel my membership moving forward (and not be charged for the next month). I wasn't told that I had to give 30 days notice (aka pay for an extra month). Though they're technically right (it IS in the contract), I feel that their staff mislead me.If you live in Shadyside (or nearby)... GO TO URBAN ACTIVE INSTEAD. It's cheaper and the facilities are unbelievably better than XShadyside... although I apparently have a membership at XShadyside for another month now, I am 100% done with that place.\n",

Why I moved up here from Orlando to be with my boyfriend who I had just started dating. I moved because Orlando on a whole sucks and I was ready to get out. My boyfriend used to play in a band as does one of his best friends now. This was their favorite spot to hang out out because all of the (female) bartenders know and love them. They used to get free or greatly reduced drinks, could be as loud and obnoxious as they wanted, etc. etc. - the ush. I tag along now because I didn't know many people in this city at first, obviously. The bar is way too small for the number of people who try to pack in at night. I've had several items off of the menu and they all left a lot to be desired. The drinks are poured strongly. At first I thought this was because the bartenders knew how the boys liked their drinks, but now I realize they're just heavy handed. Nothing here really sticks out for me. I can get the drinks properly made elsewhere for the price. Same with the food. I guess the only reason I agree to go back time after time is because of two of the bartenders - Amy and Linda. Those two are the most kick ass bartenders in Pittsburgh. Considering I currently live in Heinz, it's also pretty damn close, which works in its favor (can't wait to move ... ). Olive or Twist has a great location and, if Amy andor Linda are working, you're sure to enjoy yourself. Just keep those expectations low.\n",

            "Original: Very disappointed.  I had been to Olive or Twist for drinks and really enjoyed it but had never been there for a meal.  I was going to a show at the Benedum with a friend and made reservations about a week and a half before the show.  We arrived about 15 minutes early for our 6:00 reservation expecting we may not be able to be seated yet.  The problem is that even though I called and made a reservation (including the person answering the phone taking my name and phone number and repeating the date and time) we were told there was no reservation for our name.  The hostess said something along the lines of \"are you sure you called here to make a reservation and not somewhere else\"  Yes, I'm pretty sure I called the right restaurant...  She kept looking at the room of empty tables, looking at the book and then looking at us.  After a few minutes of back and forth, she told us the lounge upstairs was open and we were welcome to grab a table up there.  So we trudged upstairs.  All that was available were small high top tables.  Being a Friday night, it was packed with the happy hour crowd and was pretty noisy.  Not really the environment we were looking for but we decided to make the most of it.We started with the Buffalo Chicken Dip appetizer.  It is served in a martini glass with toastedfried pita chips.  It was tasty and we were surprised at how much dip there actually was.  The problems with food began with the pacing of the meal.  We had our appetizer for under five minutes when our entrees came out.  It may not have been a big deal if we were at a real table in the restaurant downstairs, but being at the high top bar tables, we had no room for our drinks, appetizer and meal.  We found ourselves stacking stuff and pulling things off the table in order to fit everything.  It was frustrating.  Not to mention that we would either have to let our entrees get cold as we finished the appetizer or let the appetizer get cold as we ate our entrees.  With as much as we enjoyed the appetizer, we were looking forward to our meals. Unfortunately, they were very disappointing.  My friend ordered the french dip sandwich with a side of mashed potatoes.  Her potatoes were ice cold and sandwich luke warm.  When she mentioned it to the server, the server said \"so would you like me to take them back or are they ok\"  When would cold mashed potatoes ever be OK  When her potatoes were brought back warmed, she was disappointed because they were called \"garlic mashed\" but she said they were pretty bland with not much garlic at all.I ordered the Caribbean Jerk Chicken.  It was described as \"grilled chicken seasoned with jerk spices, pepper jack cheese, garlic mayo and pineapple chutney on a Kaiser roll\"  No mention of a tomato.  When I got the sandwich, there were three tomatoes on it.   Thankfully I just dislike tomatoes and it wasn't an allergy issue.  There was also no pineapple chutney.  When I asked about it, the server told me they use a sauce and it must have been soaked into the roll.Overall, very disappointed.  I wanted to love Olive or Twist because I really enjoyed the time I had visited for a drink, but the dining experience was sorely lacking, especially for a dinner that was supposed to be a nice laid back start to our girl's night out.\n",

            "Translated: Very disappointed.  I had been to Olive or Twist for drinks and really enjoyed it but had never been there for a meal.  I was going to a show at the Benedum with a friend and made reservations about a week and a half before the show.  We arrived about 15 minutes early for our 6:00 reservation expecting we may not be able to be seated yet.  The problem is that even though I called and made a reservation (including the person answering the phone taking my name and phone number and repeating the date and time) we were told there was no reservation for our name.  The hostess said something along the lines of \"are you sure you called here to make a reservation and not somewhere else\"  Yes, I'm pretty sure I called the right restaurant...  She kept looking at the room of empty tables, looking at the book and then looking at us.  After a few minutes of back and forth, she told us the lounge upstairs was open and we were welcome to grab a table up there.  So we trudged upstairs.  All that was available were small high top tables.  Being a Friday night, it was packed with the happy hour crowd and was pretty noisy.  Not really the environment we were looking for but we decided to make the most of it.We started with the Buffalo Chicken Dip appetizer.  It is served in a martini glass with toastedfried pita chips.  It was tasty and we were surprised at how much dip there actually was.  The problems with food began with the pacing of the meal.  We had our appetizer for under five minutes when our entrees came out.

            "Original: At the request of a friend, we had a brief girls night out at Olive or Twist. My first impression was the outdated decor. The restaurant has carpet which I find off putting. The drink menu is extensive; but, with the exception of one person in my party, we each found our drinks far too sweet. I ordered the cucumber basil martini, which was so sweet I had to send it back. The food was mediocre. I ordered the burger medium and it was over cooked to nearly well done. And then there was the cheesy lounge singer who sang a mishmosh of singer songwriter tunes from the 80s. The music was so loud and so bad that my friends I left and headed down the street to Butcher and the Rye.\n",

I question what this place is a dive bar A sports bar A lounge on one side with pool tables and a liquor store Whatever the case their happy hour is cheap drinks so that's a plus (and what the 1 star is for) other then that the food is good but there's nothing special ( I had the caprese salad), I could make it all for 18 the price and better ingredients. the ambiance is blah and smokey so again my home would be more entertaining. The blonde bartender won't let you get a word out so I recommend you flag someone else down.

Door locked. We saw someone leave so we entered inside. The ladyhostess came up to us, I asked if they were still open. She replied with a rude tone \" no, we're closed\". I asked why they advertised a 2am closing time. She replied quickly \"its clean up hour\"Couldn't you clean AFTER 2 am WTF, why don't you post 1am closing on Weds night. Instead of every website listing 2am as a closing time. That is the most unprofessional encounter I've had in Las Vegas. Even hookers have more professionalism than that. Thank you for wasting our time, money and 3 cab rides there.I seriously doubt I'll ever stay at Mandalay Bay, or any of my friends.Thank you Wynn Encore for the comp'ed rooms.\n",

Yeah tuna tartare and steak topped with things- you know what I am talking about.So the food was really not russian fare- and the food that we did have wasnt even good!  I got the butterfish dish- i mean u cant really go wrong with butterfish-but they did.  It was disgusting.  It was served in like a bright red sauce- that stained my lips even-so gross.Very disappointing dining experience :(\n",

The first time I went I got 2 beers, drank them, attempted to pay but was told they can't run my card without at least $10 ran, so after ordering a shot to bring my bill up to par, I paid and left. I assume this is why a bottled 12oz is $4 and Miller Lite is always on 'special'. No one said anything other than \"hi, whatcha drinkin\", \"another one\" and \"that's all for ya\". The second time, it was trivia night. It seemed fun so I took a few pics of the place, the bartender, people playing trivia and the specials board. I paid for my beers with cash and left. I went back a few days later and was quickly \"greeted\" by the brontosaurus behind the bar. \"I heard you were taking pictures of us the last time you were here. You are not welcome here and need to leave.\" Now I've been kicked out of bars before, but it's because I did something wrong (got in a fight, threw up somewhere, etc), so this was a first. There were 2 people at the bar who quickly looked up and started looking me up and down. Thinking there was no good way to explain myself monosyllabically enough for her to understand, I said \"yes ma'am\" and took my leave, laughing at the situation. Everything would have been fine except as I was leaving I overheard her mumble \"pervert\". In hindsight I can see where I may have used poor judgement, or should have asked if it was ok first. And for that I am sorry. But she did not even attempt to speak to me before publicly jumping to conclusions she \"heard\" insinuating I was taking lewd pictures for my own personal pleasure. The bartenders are nothing except a lifeless ordinary, working to earn cash and doing a bad job at trying. There are other establishments near here that offer more for less, with decent conversation and pleasant aromas. For as slow as this place always seemed to be, I can't imagine why the staff are quick to judge. But perhaps that's the normal clientele that frequents this establishment, and I can see why. I obviously will never be back. If you do not want to be looked at and judged when you walk in and then talked about disparagingly when you leave, stay as far away from here as possible. There are MUCH better places that will give you fantastic service, and a conversation for a fraction of your overall cost.\n",

Not hot and sorta greasy. Wife got salad, which was unimpressive and a little wilted. Wife had filet, which she described as  a poor cut of meat, tough with gristle. I got a ribeye, if you could call it that. It appeared to be pan fried, as is was greasy. It was a very poor cut of meat, with much fat and gristle. Sweet potato was good, except it was very small.   Service was good, as we were in a group of 12.  Glasses were kept full and service prompt. Cost is hard to believe! You pay for a choice cut of meat and get Waffle House food.  I went to this place probably 15 years ago. Was not impressed then. Has gotten worse. Not inclined to go to places were they have to have armed police officers on duty for the protection of their patrons.   This placed is off the list. Will not return!\n",

The deck and the boat docks are the only reason they are still in business. If you want a drink order beer or wine. The drinks are watered down and shots are limited because the premium liquor selections are limited.  The food leaves a lot to be desired.  We ordered the smoked chicken quesadilla, mozzarella cheese sticks and a burger because we thought it would be hard to mess that up. We were wrong.  The chicken had some artifical smoke flavor added and that was the only flavor.  The filling ingredients were not evenly distributed so there were areas overloaded and areas with nothing. The cheese sticks were a lukewarm frozen product, the marina was much hotter and appears to be a frozen product nuked in little cups because the plastic was melting.  The hamburger was not seasoned and mediocre.  The fries were mushy and limp.   On top of all this the place appears grungy and dated.  The place is falling apart and obviously being run into the ground in an attempt to just milk every possible dime out of it. This is the last chance we are giving this place.

Don't take a large group because they act like accommodating you is painful. They also took forever when the restaurant seemed fairly dead. They need to remodel and hire a new chef to re-write the menu because you cannot beat the location. They also need more boat slips... it always fills up fast on the weekend!\n",

We ordered the taco special, so being \"Taco Tuesday,\" one would think these would be readily available.  Finally after 12 hour, we got our food tossed on the table.  The personable waitress didn't notice our drinks were empty, so I had to walk the glasses to the bar to get them refilled.

The bar tender went to him like files to a fresh pile of doo.

(There are lots of other bars that also don't take credit cards, but they still let you run a tab.) It made me wonder if they didn't trust me to close out my tab or if they were hoping my tip would be better prior to experiencing their poor service.In short, even on occasions when they book national acts, it's not worth going there if you're going to encounter hostility when you want something from the bar.

            "Original: Let's start this review by saying that when we are at that point, my girlfriend and I will be going to Jos. A. Bank for mine and my groomsman's suits.  Allow me to give you a numbered breakdown of the issues we encountered when renting from Men's Wearhouse to be the groomsmen in our friends wedding.1- They never contacted us after the fitting after saying there would be a followup call.  The other groomsmen and I had to follow up repeatedly to get an answer as to when our tuxedos would arrive and the staff were very short with our honest questions over the phone.2- They sent two of our tuxedos to Homestead when we asked for them to be sent to Ross Park Mall during the fitting.3- When one of us called two days prior to the wedding to ask if our tux's had arrived the guy answering the phone said \"Oh... I don't know\" (insert an awkward, pregnant pause here while waiting for him to say \"Let me check that for you\") he instead said \"Well, I'm going to hang up now.\"  And he made good on that promise, and hung up.4- Despite saying we'd get a call a few weeks ahead of the wedding to be resized in case one of us gained a few lbs over the winter, this call never came so we basically had to hope that everything fit as it needed to.5- We were at one point informed that MW had our emails on file and that when our tuxes arrived at the store we would receive an email letting us know.  Not a single groomsman received any such email to that effect.6- One of the groomsmen randomly received a black tie while everybody else had white.  Another received no studs.  We discovered this approximately two hours to show-time while relatively far from civilization.7- On picking up my tux I informed the associate \"I'll be unable to get to a Men's Wearhouse for a few days after the wedding, is this alright\" to which she responded \"Yeah that should be fine\" so when my girlfriend graciously dropped off my tux for me a few days later and learned of the $100 late fee, I was totally caught off guard.8- My girlfriend was also caught totally off guard by the associate at Ross Park Mall who was incredibly rude to her when  he informed her of said late fee.9- As the Best Man I was given a coupon card for $50 off my next rental at Men's Wearhouse.  Since I am in another wedding next month with rentals from MW I figured this would be an opportune time to use it.  Imagine my shock while paying for the next weddings rental, when I presented the coupon and was told \"Oh, that isn't for this.  That is intended for YOUR wedding.  Oh and it expires on December 31st of this year.\" 10- The groom himself decided to use a coupon to purchase a suit for the wedding and to own, rather than rent a tux for the occasion.  He was ensured by the Homestead staff that the coupon would be fine for this purpose and got fitted for it.  When he went to pick up his suit and pay with the aid of said approved coupon he was instead forced into an argument with an associate who insisted he could not use the coupon towards the suit that an associate a few weeks earlier had insisted he could use.  Granted, now I am speaking for another person so take that with as much salt as you may, but he reiterated this fact to me several times prior to his wedding last week.Over my friends wedding weekend, any time anything even went slightly wrong at and around his wedding, the joke between the Groom and his Groomsmen was \"Effing Men's Wearhouse.\"  For example, at a restaurant, \"Wait I asked for no onions on this sandwich. - Effing Men's Wearhouse!\"  \"Noise complaint at the hotel room Men's Wearhouse.\"Another groomsman looked at me when we discovered the wrong color tie one of us received and said to me \"I hope you're taking notes for your own impending wedding\" to which I replied \"Perhaps I could find better service from GoodWill of Western PA\"Congrats Men's Wearhouse.

From the get go, the gum-chewing-lip-smacking Morgan was completely lacking in anything remotely close to customer service. We arrived with a coupon from David's Bridal for $40 off a tux rental and was met with the realization that it was for Prom only (despite the small print not saying Prom only rentals). When I told her where we'd gotten the code, she agreed that yes, a $40 coupon was in David's Bridals free catalogs at the store, but she was unable to use any coupon codes to get the discount.So let me go over this: I have a coupon. Give coupon. Not valid on this transaction, but there are other coupons in the same place you got this. I don't have that coupon. Sorry cannot help you even though I know that coupon exists and the code is simply DBAW and 6 numbers.Wow, wow and wow. Some of you out there might be saying \"Well, you have the wrong coupon and even if the fine print didn't say prom only, it's what it was and too bad\" but here's the thing: CUSTOMER SERVICE. Customer service means service with a smile (no smile on Morgan but sloppy dress and bra showing, check!). Customer Service means going above and beyond (perhaps giving us a working coupon to use). Customer service means using your brain and not being a complete idiot when it comes to common sense.So, what did I do when she rang up the charge full price I called David's Bridal in NorthLake and got AMAZING customer service by the first person who picked up who was glad to tell me the current wedding coupon code, which I told to an apathetic Morgan. Me - 1, Her - 0. Chick, you don't even know the lengths I will go to so that we can save money with or without your horrible help.And what's a cake without icing Totally watched a dude smoke in front of the store and then come in and measure my boyfriend for the tux without washing his hands.

            "Original: I read a few negative reviews from other unhappy customers but I thought I would try this place out anyway. When I arrived my wife and I met Alladin, shop owner, who seemed very confident. He said he worked with pro athletes and sounded like he knew what he was talking about. He tried selling me a suit and said it would be worth the money. Later I purchased an $800 Hugo Boss suit and came back to see him to have it altered. He made all of the necessary markings and pinned the back of the jacket to be altered. A week later I came with my wife to pick up the suit and he handed me the wrong suit (good thing I checked). He didn't ask me to try the right one on so I asked if I could make sure it fit. Long story short, he never altered the jacket and the pants seam was off. He tried to charge $200 for doing nothing to the jacket which is a scam. He finally agreed to fix the jacket so sent us to lunch and made some adjustments. He didn't know how to work with the modern Hugo Boss material and you could see the stitching marks from the hem on the outside of the pants legs . WHAT A JOKE! I was going to seek legal advice but figured I would spend more on a lawyer than just making the ruined suit work.

            "Translated: I read a few negative reviews from other unhappy customers but I thought I would try this place out anyway. When I arrived my wife and I met Alladin, shop owner, who seemed very confident. He said he worked with pro athletes and sounded like he knew what he was talking about. He tried selling me a suit and said it would be worth the money. Later I purchased an $800 Hugo Boss suit and came back to see him to have it altered. He made all of the necessary markings and pinned the back of the jacket to be altered. A week later I came with my wife to pick up the suit and he handed me the wrong suit (good thing I checked). He didn't ask me to try the right one on so I asked if I could make sure it fit. Long story short, he never altered the jacket and the pants seam was off. He tried to charge $200 for doing nothing to the jacket which is a scam. He finally agreed to fix the jacket so sent us to lunch and made some adjustments. He didn't know how to work with the modern Hugo Boss material and you could see the stitching marks from the hem on the outside of the pants legs . WHAT A JOKE! I was going to seek legal advice but figured I would spend more on a lawyer than just making the ruined suit work. If you need anything complicated done or if you are have anything of value do not use this guy! PLEASE BEWARE and don't ignore these complaints like I did. There are other negative reviews out there if you look.\n",

The hem fell out of one pair already and the tailor didn't even do what I asked for on another. To top it off, the chalk marks weren't even washed or steamed out!!!

            "Original: Back in January I had to have my gall bladder removed which was a very unexpected and scary surgery for someone like me who has only ever had my wisdom teeth out. I was referred to Dr. Teng's office by a friend of mine who had the weight loss surgery that is his bread and butter. I should have waited for the doctor who I was referred to in the ER to have an opening but I was in a ton of pain and wanted to have the surgery as soon as possible. It was no surprise that my liver was inflamed and that Dr. Teng said it was the worst gall bladder case he has ever seen, but at least he got it out and although I now have an 8 inch scar it was worth it to no longer be in the kind of pain I was experiencing.I too had to pay a deposit before the surgery which I did and then six months after the surgery I received a sizable bill. I couldn't understand why after the deposit and my insurance company pitching in he was still expecting me to pay almost $800! With the ER bills leading up to the surgery taxing our finances as well you can imagine I was not thrilled. My husband tried calling the office at least three times to get the scoop on the bill. When it came in the mail it looked sketchy with no actual descriptive information on it. I could have designed a more legitimate looking invoice on my own computer! We wanted to know what we were paying for exactly and why the balance was so much. After three phone calls my husband had still not heard back from the office yet they continued to send out invoices threatening to slap us with a late payment. Honestly, who does not return phone calls!! If you are a business it is what you do! We were very frustrated.Finally my husband got ahold of Dr. Teng's head secretary or office manager who seems to think very highly of herself. She was very unhelpful and wouldn't answer his questions besides telling him to contact our insurance provider.

Each destination took 3-4 times longer to reach due to his incompetence. This caused us to have to skip a couple of our originally planned stops. After returning to the bus after one of our stops we were informed by Scott that the police had come onto the bus and searched it with dogs. Really!!  Why!!  How!!  We found that our bags had been rifled through and we all felt a little violated and confused. By this point we decided to call it a night. More than half of our passengers didn't care to step back onto the bus and took cabs home. Just when we thought the worst was over we were wrong. As we enter the highway we realize that Scott has driven all the way up the ramp and onto the highway going THE WRONG WAY!!!  He starts slowly reversing down the ramp while oncoming cars honk and swerve all around us!  Truly terrifying. After that, we were very upset and just wanted to get home. So after several more wrong turns we finally get home. Absolutely terrible night. So if you'd like to book a party bus that will include a geographically blind driver, unecessary police involvement, a near death experience and just an overall sense of frustration mixed with panic then go with these guys. Otherwise, I would suggest staying far, far away!\n",

The pictures on the website are beautiful.We found a grumpy old man at the front desk, and he could not have been less interested in our arrival. It felt like we were disturbing him to ask for our room key. But the fun started when we returned later in the evening. We found the rollaway we had requested (and paid for) not present, and I went back down to the old gentleman. He stared at me and then went back to pecking at his computer. I waited. Suddenly he looked up at me and started yelling, something to the effect that there wasn't anything that he could do, and that he would see if someone could do something but probably not. He also angrily admitted that the reservation did show the rollaway.I slunk away with my guest who had by now come down, too, embarrassed and insulted. It shouldn't be this way. If this is personalized service, I'd rather stay at a motel.Even without grumpy old man, there's nothing special about this place. The rooms were ok, but the bathrooms tiny (I guess they should be called showerrooms). Everything else was sub-par. The dining room breakfast was served in was tacky and the coffee awful. We did not dare try the free wine. The hotel is in a bad neighborhood.For the money, find a special at the William Penn on the Omni Hotels website. If you want a boutique hotel, try the Inn on the Mexican War Streets--a beautiful building with friendly owners just across from the National Aviary and that beautiful park. The Priory does not feel boutique and is not worth the hassle.Priory, get grumpy old man out of a customer-facing role.\n",

He also angrily admitted that the reservation did show the rollaway.I slunk away with my guest who had by now come down, too, embarrassed and insulted. It shouldn't be this way. If this is personalized service, I'd rather stay at a motel.Even without grumpy old man, there's nothing special about this place. The rooms were ok, but the bathrooms tiny (I guess they should be called showerrooms). Everything else was sub-par. The dining room breakfast was served in was tacky and the coffee awful. We did not dare try the free wine. The hotel is in a bad neighborhood.For the money, find a special at the William Penn on the Omni Hotels website. If you want a boutique hotel, try the Inn on the Mexican War Streets--a beautiful building with friendly owners just across from the National Aviary and that beautiful park. The Priory does not feel boutique and is not worth the hassle.Priory, get grumpy old man out of a customer-facing role.\n",
            "Original: We stayed here and was initially disappointed-- being new to town, our first impression was that Pittsburgh was a very very bad town full of homeless and degenerates (the area, I find out later, is one of the worst spots in the city!).  The hotel is located across the street from a housing authority building.  Projects  UGH.  Great.  Then we were put into a \"historical\" room that was similar to that of a rundown cheap apartment-- old shower stall, moldy threadbare carpeting, lumpy squeaky bed.  I find out an hour later (after freaking out about the lo-end aspect of this room) that they have new rooms that were just recently renovated.  I asked to see the room, and then ultimately change to that room-- for a fee, of course.  About 50% more expensive.  But I pay more because NO WAY would I be able to exist in this old \"historical\" creepy room.  Finally, a regular room-- the \"renovated\" room was similar to that of an acceptable hotel room.  Why even keep this historical, old, dingy, dirty room  Do they figure unsuspecting people who don't know any better will just accept it bc they have no other choice I slept well in the \"new\" renovated room, and would have been freaked out all night in the old room. What a difference. Actually, the bed and linens were very, very comfortable.  The bathroom was nice and clean.  The room was what I expected a hotel room to be... not high end four seasons, but not cheap and nasty either. The hotel obviously had availabilities of the new, renovated rooms, so why put us in an old, unrenovated, ugly old apartment looking room If they believed in upgrading, then they would have at least gotten repeat business!! For those who are going to book here, pay more for the new rooms, or go somewhere else.  The option of staying in the old room should not be an option at all.  I don't think I will ever go back here if I ever go back to Pittsburgh.  I will stay at a chain hotel-- marriot or whatever.  What is money except a means to be comfortable and live  I will spend more next time.Breakfast was \"eh\".  It was free-- small stations of some fruit, cheese, small pastries, cereal, yougurt and two hot items:  sausage + bacon.  OJ, Cranberry, Milk and Coffee also available.

            "Original: We decided to have a little staycation at the Priory earlier this month.  My husband made the reservation with a special they were having for a dinner date night.  With the special, they give you a few Pittsburgh restaurants to choose from and you get a $50 voucher to that restaurant.  When my husband called the Priory, they said they would make the reservations and call us back on the time.  We never got a call about the reservation time which was annoying.  But the main issue was we checked in, talked to the girl at the front desk about having the shuttle take us to this reservation at Meat and Potatoes, and she set us up with the shuttle.  We go in the room, look around for the $50 voucher, and it's not in the room so we assumed (i know we should never assume) that it was taken care of with Meat and Potatoes when they  made our reservation.  We had a fabulous dinner at M&P, great food, great service, and the bill comes.  We asked the server about this Priory $50 voucher and he had never heard about it so the manager comes over and says they didn't give them anything but to have them call and ask for him and he'll work it out.  We called the Priory and told them this, the girl who answered gave us an attitude and said you should have asked for it.  Then refused to call M&P to talk to the manager.  She just said to pay the full bill and we can work it out when we get back to the hotel.  We gave the manager our phone and he was yelled at as well about this.  He took our word that the Priory would deliver it to him the next day and he deducted the $50 from our bill.  It was embarrassing and it wasn't the issue with the money, just the service with the priory.  This showed us two things: We won't be going back to the Priory due to the lack of service and lack of respect and we WILL be going back to M&P because their service was impeccable.\n",

            "Original: This used to be the Holiday Inn and now it is the Clarion Hotel & Conference Center.  We needed to find a place not too far from Heinz Stadium for a reasonable price. We paid about $90 per night for this place, and the experience started poorly. We walked in and the two lobby TVs were tuned to Judge Judy (for the front desk employee's viewing pleasure). Employees watching reality TV during business hours really puts me off. It was hard to get the attention of the front desk staff because they were in the middle of a pizza order.  Two of the staff was working the front desk with a third suggesting toppings. It was pretty funny as one of clerks started to set up our room while another on the phone to the pizzeria kept interrupting the process with pizza questions. To the side the third clerk assisted with the pizza order. My wife pointed out her extreme cleavage, but I did not want to get lost there. We had a hard time understanding our clerk setting up the room. She tended to mumble, but did assert herself better when responding to pizza order questions. We finally got our room and headed up the very scary elevator to the 4th floor. In a way I felt as if we were at some sort of slum. I kept looking for gang tagging. The room was adequate (and I believe this was a renovated room), but a Motel 6 would be an upgrade. Whoever is doing the renovation has really poor taste and the quality of work is terrible. The swimming pool was a swamp (I am not kidding), but I am sure the frogs living in it were having a good time. The next morning we went down to the front desk again. This time the morning clerk was on a personal call and gave me an angry look because she felt that I was interrupting her call.  She did not even hang up; she just put the phone to her side, answered my question, and then continued her conversation. Personally, I think this hotel would be great for a horror movie and Hollywood should contact this place. It needs to be knocked down, or management should tighten up the staff and improve construction quality. If construction is on track (and I suspect something is wrong), get staff that really is gracious to customers. There are people that need jobs out there and I assure you with proper management they will do a great job. Don't stay here for over $45 per night (the price is due to the breakfast offered). Personally I would not stay here until they fix the place, but for some reason I don't feel that it will ever happen. Something just feels wrong. Perhaps Clarion has stopped the remodel due to the economy.\n",

            "Original: Ah, yes, what has yet to be said about this Clarion in Greentree, which is commonly known as the hotel of perpetual construction Check the reviews folks (I sure wish I had) and you'll see that this place has been under construction for at least four years!My family, and I'm sure countless others, initially had trouble even finding the place and had to humble ourselves to ask directions at the nearby Doubletree Hotel. But even with directions, we drove right past the Clarion because: 1). There are no hotel signs; 2). We were arriving at night and the building was completely dark; 3). There were no parked cars visible from the road; and 4). The entire front of the building was boarded up.When we located the correct driveway and approached the construction zone, which once represented the entrance to the hotel, we saw a tiny sign directing us to the \"Temporary Lobby\" in the back of the hotel. The makeshift lobby consisted of a hotel room with a clerk sitting at a desk. The clerk initially could not locate our reservation on her computer, but found it as soon I had dug through my luggage to find a copy of the confirmation email.We were given a room on the second floor, thus we walked past stairwells that were closed (because of endlessly drying 'wet paint') and an out-of-order (and leaking) ice machine, until we located the elevator. Well, let me tell you folks, Disney's Tower of Terror ride is less frightening than this elevator. It looked like one of those service elevators that the public never sees. The floor was covered in dead bugs and the ceiling had holes in it, leading to the conclusion that someone must have taken the globes off the ceiling lights and just dumped the dead bugs onto the floor.When we got to our room, the carpet was so covered with nasty grease stains that we wanted to keep our shoes on. We did the preliminary check of the beds and found some stained sheets, but thankfully no bugs. We also checked for the free Wi-Fi signal and found that it was completely useless (maybe that's why the desk clerk couldn't locate our reservation).Finding the complimentary breakfast in the morning was like a scavenger hunt, where you look for clues on small paper signs in the hallways. The adventure actually took me outside of the hotel and then back into another part of the building (thankfully it wasn't raining like it had been all night). I then realized that I had just entered the main construction zone and the outside route must be the only passable route to the dining area.There was yet another sign outside the dining room which said something about Complementary Breakfast and the strange phrase \"Gratuity Included.\" But inside the dining room there were at least two clearly-marked 'Tip Jars.' Now, I've been at some pretty trashy hotels in my travels, but I've never seen a tip jar in the dining room. I've also never been in a hotel dining room where it looked like a bomb had gone off, but there were drop cloths, power tools and all sorts of debris everywhere.When I got in line for the grub, I learned how the attendant earned her tips: she was there to help patrons identify the food.

Anyway, I tried this so-called health food, because the only other hot alternative was French Toast and I did not want any syrupy food that morning. Guess what The sausage had some kind of sugary additive to make the links taste like syrup! Real healthy, right Thus, I ended up just getting a cup of coffee and returning to my room to pack up. The coffee was okay, by the way.In conclusion, I would not have stayed at the Greentree Clarion had I not made prior reservations and had not been coming back after midnight following a music festival where it rained all day.

            "Translated: Ah, yes, what has yet to be said about this Clarion in Greentree, which is commonly known as the hotel of perpetual construction Check the reviews folks (I sure wish I had) and you'll see that this place has been under construction for at least four years!My family, and I'm sure countless others, initially had trouble even finding the place and had to humble ourselves to ask directions at the nearby Doubletree Hotel. But even with directions, we drove right past the Clarion because: 1). There are no hotel signs; 2). We were arriving at night and the building was completely dark; 3). There were no parked cars visible from the road; and 4). The entire front of the building was boarded up.When we located the correct driveway and approached the construction zone, which once represented the entrance to the hotel, we saw a tiny sign directing us to the \"Temporary Lobby\" in the back of the hotel. The makeshift lobby consisted of a hotel room with a clerk sitting at a desk. The clerk initially could not locate our reservation on her computer, but found it as soon I had dug through my luggage to find a copy of the confirmation email.We were given a room on the second floor, thus we walked past stairwells that were closed (because of endlessly drying 'wet paint') and an out-of-order (and leaking) ice machine, until we located the elevator. Well, let me tell you folks, Disney's Tower of Terror ride is less frightening than this elevator. It looked like one of those service elevators that the public never sees. The floor was covered in dead bugs and the ceiling had holes in it, leading to the conclusion that someone must have taken the globes off the ceiling lights and just dumped the dead bugs onto the floor.When we got to our room, the carpet was so covered with nasty grease stains that we wanted to keep our shoes on. We did the preliminary check of the beds and found some stained sheets, but thankfully no bugs. We also checked for the free Wi-Fi signal and found that it was completely useless (maybe that's why the desk clerk couldn't locate our reservation).Finding the complimentary breakfast in the morning was like a scavenger hunt, where you look for clues on small paper signs in the hallways. The adventure actually took me outside of the hotel and then back into another part of the building (thankfully it wasn't raining like it had been all night). I then realized that I had just entered the main construction zone and the outside route must be the only passable route to the dining area.There was yet another sign outside the dining room which said something about Complementary Breakfast and the strange phrase \"Gratuity Included.\" But inside the dining room there were at least two clearly-marked 'Tip Jars.'

            "Original: This was by far the worst hotel experience I've ever had. It wasn't just that there was MASSIVE construction going on, but they did nothing to accommodate for it. They put us in a dirty floor with exposed ceilings, spackle, and sheetrock everywhere. The lights were broken and the room was filthy. The second room they out me in had an air conditioning unit that wouldn't reach the outlet, rendering it useless in the middle of the summer, had no toilet paper and water all over the bathroom floor. The CHILDREN working the front desk, which was located in a hotel room, gave the worst customer service, greeted me with an attitude, and couldn't manage to pull themselves away from their own conversation long enough to even check me in in a timely manner. The worst. Do not stay here.\n",

That leads us to the elevator. Norman bates would even say it's too creepy for him. It's marked with two different hotel names on top of that, holiday inn and ramada. Then the room. Not the worst of the worst, the decor is nice, the bed is as hard as a rock and the shower isn't even properly installed. Really wish I would have looked at yelp before booking here. Buyer beware.

            "Original: I was at the Visulite Saturday night and it was a terrible experience. I bought tickets online 2 days prior to the show. It was listed as a headliner and that the doors opened at 8pm with 2 opening acts. We got there right on time and were denied entrance. Jam Base had listed it as one show and when I bought tickets on the Visulite website it was for 1 show. We were aggressively all told that we would have to pay for the first person on stage or we would have to come back later. What Then we were told, \"it was made very clear on the website\" at which point the guy whipped out his clip board and showed us some piece of paper and was like, \"don't make me pull up the website.\" If it was made so clear... why were we having this discussion To say the least, the guy takingselling tickets was a jerk and the door guy was a total bully. He not only told said, \"are you talking about MY ticket guy in there you better watch yourself or you won't be coming back!\" Really First of all, I'm a hard working polite female that does not deserve to be bullied around by some oaf that thinks HIS job is that important to keep squirrely little girls like me out of there. What am i going to do kick him in the shins tell him he's a meanie there are better ways to handle a situation. Second, I was not talking back to this guy or arguing. I was trying to figure out why on earth I would have to buy separate tickets for 1 nights worth of music at the same venue. We ended up going to Crown Station (which is an awesome spot with very nice people) and headed back in time for the show. Again, the door guy was a bully saying, \"looks like you came back for a 2nd try, huh you better watch yourself this time.\" To say the least, I asked the bartender to speak to a manager and apparently there was not one there on this particular evening. I have to say, the bartender was extremely nice and apologized about 3 times over. This used to be my FAVORITE venue in Charlotte to see music, but after this terrible experience, I will not be returning. I remain very upset about this situation and can't imagine the band would be very happy knowing their fans are being bullied and talked down to at the front door. As for the sound... once we finally made it in, it was extremely loud and impossible to hear any words that the guys were actually singing. Super bummed about the whole evening... but would also be very willing to talk to a manager...\n",

Beware, when you order water, they bring out bottled (and charge you), so if you want tap you need to ask and depending on your Spanish or their lack of English, that may be a challenge.

            "Original: Came here with our family and there are only 5 of us. Ordered pupusas and fried plantain. It took a while before the food came out. This place is a hole in a wall but we were willing to try it out because of the good reviews here. We got our food...plantain was good. The shrimp pupusas was my fave amongst beef and pork. It was alright...had better.  We got the bill and noticed that they already included the gratuity. Coming from Vegas, I have no problem paying gratuity but for it to be included on the bill for 5 people  That's unheard of. So I came up to the cashier to inquire about it, one of the girl from the cashier pulled out the menu and said, \"that's our rule...six people or more we have to include gratuity\". So I stood there a little confused until I came back to our table and my sis reminded me that there are only 5 of us. So I went back and asked the cashier that there were only 5 of us so she shouldn't include the gratuity. Then all of a sudden both girls that were in the cashier counter said that the rule was changed to 4 people. Mind you...this is within 2-3 minutes time frame, their rules changed from 6 people to 4 people. When I asked why they did not mention earlier that it was changed from 6 to 5...she kept on saying \"call the manager\" and was saying this rudely.\n",

The chairs were the cheap plastic chairs you use when you havee guests in your backyard and don't give a crap about their comfort.  The atmosphere was tacky and unimpressive.I ordered a chicken sandwich special as I didn't see any torta one the menu (what respectable Cuban place doesn't have a simple torta on their menu!).  The sandwhich was dry and flavorless and tasted as if it received no seasoning at all.  My companions all looked at their food after tasting it and were disappointed as well.Receiving a refill on a water was like asking the government to stop spending money, it just wasn't going to happen.Horrible experience, bland food, overpriced.

            "Original: Voucher 2518-6167I am seeking a refund for my voucher to Havana Cafe. Last night I went to Havana Cafe. When we entered the restaurant the hostess approached us and asked us if we had a reservation. We told her we did not and she said that they were booked up but we could eat in the bar. There were at least 6 tables open. It wasn't our first choice, but we said okay. We sat in the bar and the waitress took our drink order. After about 20 minutes the bar tender asked if our orders had been taken. We said no and he asked if he could get an appetizer started for us. We ordered our appetizers and waited for the waitress to come take our dinner order. While we waited, some other people came in and we heard them say that a 10-15 minute wait for a table was not too long. We asked them if they had a reservation and they said no, they just came in. A couple at the table next to us said they too had been told they couldn't eat in the dining room. While my friend went tell the waitress that we wanted a table, a waiter came to the table with 2 appetizers. He tried to give me the wrong one and I told him that the other one was ours. He walked away with both appetizers. I and someone at the table next mine tried to call him back but he kept going. The waitress finally came to take our orders. The appetizer waiter again came by with our appetizer and walked past our table twice. The waitress had to stop him and tell him to give it to us. We were finally moved to a table and waited for our food. When the food finally came, they brought all of the food at the same time, instead of bringing my friends salad before the entree. Also, my salad was nothing like what was listed on the menu and had ingredients that I am allergic to. I told the waiter that this was not the entree salad that I ordered and that I was allergic to some of the ingredients. At this point we asked to speak with the manager. After 10 minutes of watching the manager come in and out of the dining room, going around to talk to people at other tables we asked for the manager again. Our entrees were brought out to us. They brought the exact same salad to me and my friend's entree had clearly been sitting under a heat lamp. The waiter said that he would get the menu so he could show me that it was the right salad. The manager still hadn't come to us so my friend went to him. From across  the room, I could see from his body language that the manager was not in any way responsive to our issues. When my friend returned to the table, she told me that he was rude to her, until she mentioned that she knew the owner. The manager then came to our table. When we brought up the fact that my salad was nothing like anything on the menu and the fact that when we told the waiter that I was allergic to some of the unlisted ingredients, he apologized and said that sometimes the chef changes the ingredients and the menu isn't changed. I explained that this could be life threatening for some people.  He offered to have the salad remade, but at this point I was not confident in their care for allergy issues and declined. After 2 hours in the restaurant, we left without eating. The manager did end up giving us gift certificates for a return visit - it is highly unlikely that I will return.\n",

All the dishes we ordered were disgusting!  The fried meat (carne frita) that she ate was dry and flavorless. The mofongo she had was unlike any other we have ever tried. She asked me to try and I just couldn't swallow it. We both love mofongo so that was very disappointing. It doesn't end there my dish was the Puerto Rican plate so I was excited and thought it would bring back some memories of my hometown but it only brought back nightmares. The rice with pigeon peas (arroz con gandules) had way too much tomato sauce... I can go on forever but would rather not. I will just jump to the desert. We thought maybe since the meal was so horrible maybe they could redeem themselves with an awesome flan. When we ordered the flan the waitress said they did not have the large portion but she  could give us the two smaller portions. We said OK but to our surprise the flan was so pale and the taste was so bland. I looked at it carefully and noticed that it had the recycling symbol on it. Who does that!!!  Come on really!  I'm done with this place. I would never eat at this restaurant even if they paid me. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone unless I hated them.\n",

We were actually really excited to give Columbian food a try, but for whatever reason, hadn't gotten around to using our coupon. We finally decided to just make a plan, and go for it. We looked over the menu and were really looking forward to coming here. We were expecting a little hole in the wall, with simple but tasty food. And maybe that is what we would have gotten on a different day. Unfortunately, the day we went, two major red flags were present. 1. When we walked in, a handful of people were sitting in the \"front\" room, which is basically a convenience store front with a few tables. We weren't offered a seat in this room. Rather the hostess walked us to the larger back room- where the lights were turned off. She told us they were off because they were trying to cool the restaurant down- there is no air conditioning in the building. We arrived at 6:00 pm on a Wednesday. It didn't seem as though they were expecting customers. 2. The second we walked in, my fiance and I both instantly noticed that the entire building wreaked of sewage. The smell could not be ignored. Sorry, but if the place I'm going to eat at smells like waste, I don't have confidence in your sanitary practices. I've never been in a restaurant that smelled, and we immediately left. The health department might want to drop in for an inspection.\n",

Being that this restaurant is a Latin restaurant where most clients speak Spanish, I wrote my review in Spanish but here's my review in English.THREE TIMES, I have received bad food!  I would NEVER recommend this place to anyone for Salvadorean food.I tried to give the place a chance but after three times of the same bad food, I just decided its best to let go.The chicken or fish dinner plates are horrible.  The meat itself is dry and it seems they are not fresh.  When these complaints are brought to the staffs and subsequently to the owners attention they simply are indifferent and do nothing to resolve the problem.The last time, I ordered to go and was so angry after I got home and discovered a poorly cooked and tasting fried fish. Gross. I immediately called and over the phone the owner offered to refund the money or another replacement dinner the following day as they were closing for the night. So I was without dinner that night and had to put something simple and quick at home. The next day and the following days after, nobody wanted to do good on their word of giving me a replacement dinner, even though the owner claimed he would leave a note to inform his staff in charge.  i didn't even want my money but after a few days i demanded a refund, and it was then that they offered to replaced the fish, the fish ONLY because they felt that was the only thing that was not to par.  seriouslylol i laughed at their lack of professionalism.  who buys a dinner plate just for one of the items a dinner plate is made up of all the items on it to provide you with a delicious eating experience. that means the salad, the rice as well.  so that day they only gave me a fish! LOL i felt that i was transported to El Salvador, a third world country.  Certainly thats the only place where they would think this to be good business practice.They're a joke! The food is horrible. The chicken and fish is not fresh. Even the second fish was in the same condition.  One of the waitresses even made a comment that's how they do things. She even suggested ordering pupusas as they tend to have less issues with that, some times.  Only because you are a Latin restaurant that doesn't mean you have to provide a substandard service.  There are many other Latin restaurants that do a great job.  This place needs to take notes from them.\n",

I waited nearby at a coffee shop, went back after another five minutes, and it was still locked and I hadn't received a call.  And I am definitely not estimating the time, either.  I was willing to wait a bit, and I looked very closely at the time on my phone to be sure that I wasn't jumping the gun on calling and then leaving.  Finally, I went on with my day and when I got home, they had left a voicemail on my HOME PHONE, which I had specifically asked them not to call, saying, \"Oh hi.  Sorry you missed me, but I was MAYBE two minutes late at the most.  I hope you haven't left, but you should just call back to reschedule.'

It never did look right, so I just fixed it at home rather than going back to these incompetent people. I didn't even feel like the hassle of complaining was worth it, as I highly doubted that I'd get any money refunded and I certainly didn't want them to touch my hair again to try to fix it. I then figured, hey, this place sucks for haircuts but they can't mess up eyebrow waxing, right Right! But their service is so bad that I gave up on that too -- I got my eyebrows done here a few times with not much trouble, but the last time I went in, I had called ahead to put my name in and was told that I would be next on the list, and to show up in about 20 min. My house is a 20 min walk from there, perfect! I headed out, got there in 20 min, and gave the woman at the desk my name and reminded her I'd called ahead. There was one man sitting there waiting, who I had seen from across the street walking in about 1 min ahead of me. The \"stylist\" was just finishing up a haircut, so I should have been next, right, since I had put my name in before the guy who walked in Nope! She called him over and I said \"sorry, I think I was next, I called ahead and was told I'd be next in line\" and the lady said \"oh we don't do that.\" WTF You told me very clearly that you do exactly that, what craziness is this So I waited, figuring that I'd already invested 20 min into this venture, so I may as well stick it out. And waited, and waited, while one \"stylist\" cut the man's hair and 2 of them chatted in the back (ironically next to the chair where they do facial waxing). They must have been \"on break,\" or maybe just terribly rude and idiotic, because I sat there waiting for another full 20 min, and when I finally spoke up again to ask when someone would be available to do my eyebrows. The 2 chatty cathies in the back looked over, very annoyed at my presence, and the woman doing the haircut said \"after I'm done here,\" and I sat there incredulous for another 2 minutes before getting up and leaving.

            "Original: And so....the search for a new hair salon continues. Sigh. Don't get me wrong, the cut was a good cut. The salon itself was clean and stylish. The owner, welcoming and friendly. Now what went wrong. The cut was good, but it certainly wasn't what I expected from a salon with the reputation of Izzazu. I wasn't bowled over by my stylist's professionalism either. Don't diss my previous stylist....she rocked....you don't do yourself any favors by knocking someone else.

That being said, for $55 (and saving big bucks on gas, tolls, lunch and shopping) the cut was still a deal.

So when I got back to the office, I went online and checked. Nope, it said $55 for a Master Stylist WOMEN's haircut. Hmmmmm. So I called. The chick at the counter now said, \"Oh, our stylist's charge whatever they feel the cut SHOULD be.\" What So I quoted the prices to her from the Izzazu website. She changed her tune again. \"Oh, well.....I'll refund you $10 if you give me your credit card number.\" Didn't she have my slip with the card number \"Sorry, I don't give my credit card number over the phone.\" \"Or I can send you a gift certificate.\" \"Nope,\" I said through clenched teeth, \"I won't be coming back.\"It wasn't the cut. It was the bait and switch. I'd gladly have paid it had they been up front and above-board ahead of time. As Judge Judy says, \"Don't pee on my leg and tell me it's raining.\" The search goes on. Or I'll be back in Cleveland in the spring for the next cut!P. S.  One amusing side note:  I checked in at Izzazu when I arrived.  Turns out, I'm the Duchess!  The Duchess is displeased.\n",

They made no attempt to reschedule me with someone else or call me to cancel. To make things worse, the battleax at the front desk had such an attitude. Here's a tip, when you are in the beauty salon business, staff the front desk with someone who looks like they have actually BEEN to a salon. Not with rude women that have hairdos from 20 years ago. Will never go back.\n",

Then they didn't bother to ask hubby if he wanted anything to drink after he had picked one of the $12 entrees that come with coffee or juice. We had to tell someone else to get it for us. Also they don't really wash their cups. There are 2 sink basins at the front where they just dunk the cups in one soapy basin then dunk the cups in a second water basin and then stack them next to the sink. It made me not want to drink my water even though I was thirsty. Good idea, but poorly executed food. I've had good vegan and vegetarian food before that's consisted of a lot of fresh greens, avocados, and more. For a vegetarian place, there was nothing green on our plates. This experience sadly fell enormously short of our expectations... Could've eaten at kaya or meat and potatoes for the same price.\n",

            "Original: My guess is that \"Ruth K.\" was put up to writing a nice review by the staff or owner.  Regent Square deserves a better coffee shop, run by someone with good business sense.  What kind of a \"business\" only prepares food (chickentuna salad, hummus) once a week  Does chicken salad hold a week in your fridge  Also, whenever they lose an employee, they just shuffle their schedule and close at 6 pm for a few months.  They should be open till 10 pm as it is, with all the foot traffic in the neighborhood, especially in the summer. My guess is they see this place as nothing more than a loss leader for the bar they own next door.   Otherwise you would think that since opening in 1995 they could at least take the time to slap a coat of fresh paint on the place!BTW, Katerbean did go smoke free before the Allegheny County ordinance went into effect, but the place to this day reeks of stale smoke.Added note: looks like my previous review was somehow deleted.  I'll just say I received an order of hummus that was watery and had rotting celery in it.  Tried to get another and 3 or 4 of the orders in the case were all in the same condition. I asked for a refund, and afterwards watched the kid working there put the other containers back in the cooler to sell to other customers. That was the last straw.  I won't spend another dollar there.\n",

This place has been here for years, and as I sit drinking my bitter, bitter coffee, and smelling the overwhelming scent of (I believe) dog pee, I wonder how it's even possible.  The three times I've been here, I'm greeted as if I'm a colonial space marine trying to fish a child out of a vent.  They always sit in the corner peeking over the top of the counter as if I am terrifying to them, then duck out of the way.  Then grudgingly come when I peek around the counter at them.  If I didn't, I'm convinced that they would just sit there, as if they're not certain of what position they hold in this place, or what the next step should even be.  This is what I like to call, \"The Dance of Shitty Customer Service.\"  Today (and I write this longingly looking over at Square Cafe) I decided to give it a chance because it never is crowded, and I figured the quiet would be a good thing.  The girl at the counter was on the phone, and that's the way it stayed for two minutes until I said 'excuse me'.  The charming reply: \"Yeah\" She grudgingly got off the phone, and after accomplishing the Herculean task of handing me a cup, I pumped this swill that I'm currently drinking.She's currently muttering under her breath back in her corner.  I'm not sure if maybe she's having a bad day, or she's just an asshole, but...if I had to bet, I'm going with asshole.This place has pretty expensive coffee for how awful it is, and the food...Just don't eat the food.  (side note: this place isn't quiet at all when somebody orders something.  She stomps around like she's being sent to her room.  Then continues muttering)Okay, so this place is a travesty.  Bad coffee, bad odor, bad lighting, unbelievably bad, grudging service.  I would beg the owners to put any effort into this place.  As it is now, it's cornered the market in Regent Square, and sits like a middle finger boastfully pointing at the people of Braddock Avenue.\n",

All she did was go to the register to ring us up the price difference - a whopping 11 cents! Seriously You're going to make us pay an 11 cent price difference on a mistake YOU made AND after we tipped your rude ass already Whatever - we paid the 11 cents and waited for her to remake our drink. After she was done making our drink, she just put it on the counter without saying anything to us and walked away. We grabbed our drinks and got the hell out of there.

            "Original: Tried this place out for the first time yesterday since the hubby was craving boba, and it was the closest one on our way home. I got the honey lemon tea, while he got the strawberry tea. My drink okay, not overly sweet, and had a hint of a rosy aftertaste, probably from the tea. His tea, however, sucked pretty badly. First they got his order wrong and gave him a strawberry milk tea. It would have been okay had his drink tasted good, but it tasted terrible. Despite him not wanting to, I forced him to take it back since it was their mistake anyway. They finally gave him his strawberry tea, but to his disappointment, it tasted like faucet water with an over abundance of sweetener. It was so bad that he threw his drink away after only a couple of sips. Maybe it's just us since we are used to the quality of tea we get at QQ boba in henderson, but this place really isn't worth coming back to.\n",

I couldn't taste any avocado in the drink at all and it was sooooooo sweet, it was just like drinking liquid Splenda sugar. Taro milk tea, yuck yuck, way way too (artificial sweetener) sweet with absolutely no taro flavor at all.

When we got there, he first ordered a boba for me and began his dozen donuts order. The donuts he wanted (namely chocolate... Simple to make you would think) was not available at 1AM. He then asked for another type of donut (Boston cream)... Not available. Only ones they said they had at that time of night was glazed, raspberry filled, and lemon filled. He declined the donuts altogether because he was frustreated with continually getting \"sorry, we don't have that\".I gave this place a one star on his behalf and because I had my boba drink and it was descent, however, nowhere near the best I've tasted. I like my boba squishy and not too rough to chew. I tried boba at this one Viet restaraunt that was better but that's another yelp review in the making.Overall, case and point: we may have been better off going there earlier in the day and their selection seems to be EXTREMELY limited after typical business hours. If your business is said to be open 24 hours AND you're one of the only open available donut shops in the area that never close, PLEASE have a majority of your donut selection available around the clock.

What a pity.\n",

I ask for the basic flavor strawberry and they did not carry it. The person over the counter seemed confused and did not know what he was doing.

My personal experience with this establishment yesterday was unpleasant. Walked in yesterday late afternoon to try this place and there's a family on one table enjoying their ice cream and two Chinese female in their early twenties who wear a hoochie mama type of clothing ahead of me ordering.  The Chinese dude in his 50's taking orders is somewhat extra nice to these 2, which is fine, suggesting to sample all the diff type of ice cream. When female one ordered, he asked female 2 about what she wants and she said she didn't want any. The Chinese counter guy said \" oh u should've tasted more free samples while u were waiting\"..., my point is when it was our turn, my daughter tried one flavor of ice cream and when she wants to try another flavor, the guy had this annoyed look and said \" I can let her try another flavor but I need to scoop the ice cream & drop it to to her \"USED PLASTIC SPOON\".... What a rude ass!  He said its a waste to give my daughter a new spoon! That's the 1st reasons why they scored one.2nd - while he's about to do my Boba, the family who's about to leave decided to order some soda, the bastard stop and took their freaking order. Not sure if I have the look of a PUSH OVER, but I know my face doesn't look friendly anymore.Last, the register broke. The dude was now clueless on what to do so the family who were paying for the soda helped him to figure out what they owe.After 20 minutes of hell and mistreatment, he can probably tell I'm about to explode and let him have it.... He gave me a scoop of ice cream to top my Boba for the inconvenience and I can tell from his face, he don't really wants to do this.To be honest, the wait doesn't bother me but the fact that this perv was ALL nice and giddy to these young hoochie female and he wants us to re use our freaking plastic spoon the it's reason of the 1 star. Their Boba by the way is just 2 stars. I'd rather go to Cefiore down the road or better yet, Fresh cup in chinatown. Btw.... The red bean Boba is so bad..we drove straight to Human Bean and got Snowy Mocha instead. I know it's not Boba but were almost home so I got coffee instead.\n",

Then we asked to have the brownie warmed up since she failed to ask if we wanted it warmed up before hand. They took the ice cream off and just handed it to us in a cup (I honestly would have replaced every thing) They proceeded to warm the brownie and burnt it. Then 10 minutes later still no warm brownie. She said the brownie was soft but still chilly and asked if it was okay....I mean I guess we've been waiting a while so nevermind already..the icecream was half melted any way.

She was told by TLC that she could stay there up to 100 days. Then suddenly, after less than 2 weeks she was told she had to leave...period, no notice. Once again the Solari rep showed up only this time she stated that she could only stay 2 days in Solari. Moved her the following day. TLC on site social worker was usually no where to be found and never returned her calls or the many pages the receptionist made for her stating \"I know she's here, I don't know why she's not responding\".Avoid this place at any costs!\n",

            "Original: If I could give this place Zero stars I would.  They hire personnel with NO health care experience to run the Expressions (Memory Care) Unit.  My mother was a resident there (she had Alzheimersdementia) until she passed away.  I didn't write a review prior as I feared that the care she received would be even worse.  Imagine visiting your Mother and finding her with fooddirt caked on her hands so thick that you had to scrub her hands before you could hold her hand to help her stand up.  Or how about taking her to get her hair done and her scalp had the worse case of \"cradle cap\" that the stylist had ever seen.  Her dr even advised the personnel at Prestige that they needed to do a better job washing her hair, use special shampoo and watch her while showering to make sure she washed the shampoo out if her hair.  The worst experience was when my mother fell and they sent her in an ambulance to the hospital with no paperwork or personnel fromPrestige with her.  She didn't even know who she was at this point!!!  By the time I got to the hospital the people there are trying to ask her questions and don't know why she can't answer them.  To cap off this awful experience when my mother's death was imminent I sent an email with explicit instructions as to what they were to do when she passed.  I was assured \"your directives will be followed\".   Needless to say THEY WERE NOT!!!!!!!  I called to check on my mother at 8:30 in the morning to see how she was doing that day and was told what they did for her the night prior.  When I questioned them again I was told \"Oh she died at 3:00 this morning didn't anyone call you\"  When I got ahold of the facility director all I got from her was\"I guess we messed up.\"  Real compassion there.  Maybe they spend all there time making the place look nice and playing games but they sure missed the boat when it came to taking care of my mother.  If you are going to have to put a loved one here you might want to think again.  For $4,500 per month you think you would be able to get better care.  If we could have taken care of my mother in our own home I would have.  If we had unlimited resources I would have moved her to another place.\n",

            "Original: My mother recently received rehabilitation services from Freedom Plaza. The people that work at Freedom Plaza are very friendly. Beyond that there is very little positive I can say about her experience there. In the 2 weeks of her, supposed, rehabilitation she never walked more than 150 feet. She had been labeled a liability. This is interesting, considering the entire reason she was sent there was to walk and rehabilitate after open heart surgery. She walked more in the hospital ICU than she did at Freedom Plaza.  During her two weeks there she was not showered or bathed one time.  She was continually pulled up out of her recliner by her arms, which is contraindicated after open heart surgery. We met with case management to address our concerns, but none of them were addressed. Case management rarely returned phone calls. I would not send my mom back to Freedom Plaza given the choice. I would not recommend that anyone send their loved one there for rehabilitation. They may do a good job at long term care but they do not do a good job at rehabilitation.\n",

            "Original: Ehhhh...not so much.While the building, level of service, and rooms were in line with a typical Holiday Inn, the staff and management committed an egregious offense against me - a returning and Priority Club customer.Brief summary of my horror story - We check in, we get the wrong room.  They move us, give us keys to a filthy room.  We bring that up and leave for the day for them to clean it.We get back to the room, and I check my bank account and find a significant amount of money missing - $329.  After spending about an hour on the phone with my bank, we trace the charges to the Holiday Inn I am staying at via the card that I have left for incidentals.Despite prepaying for the room, we've now given the Holiday Inn about $600 for a two-night stay in a $110  night room.Furthermore, the banks had closed so I couldn't transfer more money into my checking account until after the weekend.  It wasn't that I didn't have access to cash, but I had financial fraud to deal with on what was supposed to be a fun weekend with the guys.When I bring it up at the front desk, I am immediately given run around.  They pull up my info on their computer, and gasp as they see their error.  The staff wouldn't take ownership of their mistake, they simply blamed a computer error.  I finally get a manger who says he'll deal with the issue, and I don't receive any further communication, as I'm pretty sure he wasn't planning on working during the weekend.The next day of my stay I call the front desk again, and demand answers.  This manager was a bit more assertive in handling the issue.  She spent time on the phone with my bank, and then my bank conferenced me in as we searched for a way to overcome Holiday Inn's costly error.After dealing with this issue for about 5 total hours, it becomes apparent that there is no way my money will be returned until after the weekend.  I demand to only pay half of my hotel bill, which is immediately granted.  By then I was tired of dealing with the issue and took their bill reduction as adequate compensation.Ultimately, don't use a debit card to pay for incidentals on a hotel room, because hotel systems may automatically withdraw an egregious amount of funds from your account, which could cash screw you for the weekend.  Also, DON'T STAY AT HOLIDAY INNS because the staff and management is comprised of lazy, lying, and incompetent thieves.That is all.\n",

The staff is very rude and does not go out of their way to smile or go the extra mile.  The decor is bright and nice, but it is not maintained very well.  The lobby could use a good cleaning.  Also, there is a $15day charge for parking at this hotel.  The location is great, you can walk to pretty much anywhere, but it is very noisy even on higher floors.  We were mostly disappointed because we got a double room for Valentine's day and when we asked to for a king room, J.J. told us that we had booked online so we got whatever they had.  We felt like we were treated as second rate citizens because we had booked online.  Then when we got to the room, the faucet was so loose it fell over.  It was fixed promptly, but made a bad first impression.  Neither time my husband and I have stayed at this hotel have we had a good experience.  I would strongly recommend staying at one of Charlotte's other nice hotels if you want a good experience.\n",

The Phoenix location makes me feel like going back to Portland for that type of abuse.  Phoenix is much worse.  The teachers don't give your grades promptly, nor do they explain what they are expecting to see from you to determine the difference between a 79, 85 and 93 on a project for example.  They are supposed to submit these grades so you can check them online.  I have yet to have a teacher who actually does.  When you finally corner your teachers to get your grade, they just tell you that you are doing fine.  I was a straight a student with a previous BS degree.  I attend all my classes and turn in every assignment on time.  I am an actor pursuing a film and video degree, I have never considered myself an artist (drawer, painter, sculptor).  I do not mind having to take these classes for my degree, but I just wanted to keep my GPA high.  I have never had so many B+'s in my life.  Some folks would be OK with those grades, however, I am a serious student and pride myself on my GPA.  The teachers at this school don't seem to care about truly helping students.  It definitely seems like they just hand out grades arbitrarily and don't place much emphasis on returning your tests and assignments promptly.  Even some of my A's were just given to me because of how the teachers may have felt about me.If you are not in the culinary program, then you are definitely the redheaded step-child at this school.If you are not a video game nerd, an artsy gay looking femme, or a hot fashion design chick, then you may feel like an outcast at this school.I am a non-traditional student and a transfer student, their bullshit sales tactics and focus in not designed to reach these demographics.I am clean-cut, in my 30's, prior military veteran, former college football player, and have already worked in the profession I am pursuing a degree in.   I have yet to feel welcomed by any staff member or fellow student at this school, accept for security when they ask to see my ID.You are not allowed to pick your own classes or schedules at this school.  They \"somehow\" register your classes for you, then you have to go through much hassle to change it to a more convienient plan.If you are a transfer student, (even from another Ai in the same degree program).  Prepare to be screwed in you degree audit.It is very difficult to find personal tutoring on a project or software program.  Even though they advertise differently.The only decent thing about this school is, that they do have decent gear and equipment, and the people who work in the rental cage are very helpful.  However, you have to have permission to check out gear overnight or over the weekend.  This just seems like an extra hustle, and other schools don't have this policy.  All in all, this school really sucks.  If you are disciplined and focused you can get what you need out of this school, but you will regret the price and experience later.  If you are a virgin, nerd or loser looking to meet and mingle with your peers, and figure out what you want out of life, then this is the school and experience that you need to have.  Otherwise, if you are young and seeking the traditional college experience, or older and already have a job and other obligations, then I suggest you go to a \"real\" college or university.  ASU or U of A are some good ones.  They don't need to hire and train people to be sleazy salesmen in order to pressure you to come to their schools, they actually have prestige, and they don't need to advertise solely to losers at home sitting on the couch, watching daytime network TV, dreaming about a career in....Like the Art Institutes have to.\n",

The fact that the word Karate is over the door of a Taekwondo facility is due to the fact that they are not sanctioned by the  KoreanTaekwondo association as their forms, techniques and testing are not approved nor recognized. Students are passed from one belt to the next regardless of how they perform during testing. Simple logic is, pass the kids, make them happy so they keep coming in and paying the monthly fee. The basic phylisophy of martial arts is nothing more then a pledge they say at the start of each class, but zero is done to ensure these words are understood or followed. Most of the kids are out of control and disrespectful to the instructors and other students.

The fact that the word Karate is over the door of a Taekwondo facility is due to the fact that they are not sanctioned by the  KoreanTaekwondo association as their forms, techniques and testing are not approved nor recognized. Students are passed from one belt to the next regardless of how they perform during testing. Simple logic is, pass the kids, make them happy so they keep coming in and paying the monthly fee. The basic phylisophy of martial arts is nothing more then a pledge they say at the start of each class, but zero is done to ensure these words are understood or followed. Most of the kids are out of control and disrespectful to the instructors and other students. Any attempt to voice the slightest bit of constructive critism is met with anger followed by bullying emails. If you want real martial arts, go somewhere else, this place is a joke.\n",
            "Original: Do research on karate and compare schools. This school puts emphasis on katas and teaches very little sparring. Ranks are questionable at best. If you want to do nice katas and you do not care about learning real karate or practical self defense this school may work for you. This school is also not at many locals tournaments, red flag. Took my child out and put them in another school. He's now having to relearn everything and realizing they could have gotten really hurt becouse they thought they were learning self defense. It's dangerous. But, if you want to exercise and learn Kata dancing and point sparring this could be a good fit, otherwise please do your homework.Teenagers are doing most the teaching. Or adults with new black belts.\n",

            "Original: I wished I could give them zero stars. My daughter attended coach Ed's the high rollers class and was harassed and treated awful. This coach has a demeaning attitude and makes excuses for everything.  I noticed from the first class that the coach didn't have patience with the kids and would get frustrated if they didn't do the moves correctly even on the first try. During the second class my daughter had a blister and asked the coach if she could go to the bathroom to wash off the chalk. I could see from the viewing window that he grabbed her hand and could also see my daughter's face in pain. My daughter came running to me and he had squeezed her hand so tight that he burst her blister. My daughter is not sensitive at all and has taking gymnastics at other gyms and I know that this is not the way to threat kids. After the class I talked to the coach and all got from him was complaints about how the other coaches in the gym don't see eye to eye with him and he deviated the conversation to other stuff,. I also talked to my daughter's previous coach to explain my concerns. I was told that since he only had two-three fingers in one hand he might have burst her blister by mistake, but said that his demeanor was different from all the other coaches. During her last class she was told by the coach Ed if she was deaf multiple times and was told to go away. During my whole time dealing with this coach was pure torture for me and my daughter, he does not give kids a chance to learn the moves nor he showed that he cared about the kids or had regard for parents. After that incident my daughter walked out of the class and told me everything. I immediately talked to the front desk and she informed me that the gym knew of coach Ed and that they he has had previous problems with other parentskids. I spoke with the owner, but I got the feeling that I was ignored. I got part of my money back, but not all because she said that I only had a problem with one coach. To me it shows that she does not take responsibility for her employees and did not really showed much concern. Yes it was only one coach, but it only takes one person to do damage. My only regret is taking my daughter here, and I will not referred anyone to this hell place. Their website contradicts to what actually happens here..beware it is not a safe learning environment.\n",

            "Original: This review is based on observing my daughter's class in the 'firecrackers' group...I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS COMPANY FOR 'FIRST TIMERS' OR INEXPERIENCED TODDLERS. How class goes; there are two instructors per class. One instructor gives a quick demonstration giving them instructions what to do on the equipment at each station. The kids chose which station they want to start at and then they rotate from station to station. What I've been seeing; all the kids are at different skill levels, different heights, different ages, and some are better at following directions than others. While some of the children are able and capable of maneuvering around the equipment themselves other children who are too little or inexperienced end up waiting around until either A. The instructors finally make their way to helping a different station, B. a kid gets impatient and has to ask the instructor for help or C. The child gets bored and starts wandering around and doing whatever they please, getting in the way of the other kids. Let me be honest and say, my daughter was definitely 'C'. She is too short to reach most of the equipment on her own, she is also inexperienced in gymnastics and she has a high energy level with very little attention span. Throughout most of class she was waiting around for help, get bored and do her own thing ultimately getting in the way of everyone else. Several times neither of the instructors noticed that she walked away to another class or was off in a corner away from everyone just playing by herself. The instructors neglect in engaging with the children. All I have seen them do is spot the children on the equipment. They do not have any kind of activities for the children to do together as a class, they do nothing to make their learning experience a fun experience. I'm not trying to tell anyone how to do their jobs but perhaps it could be beneficial to divide the kids into two groups, one group per instructor and start at two different stations rotating together, keeping the kids into two groups instead of four-five. Maybe that way the kids can each possibly get more attention from the instructor and even be kept an eye on more easily. I don't know if it would work, but its a suggestion...they definitely need to rethink what they can do to better organize the class as a whole and better engage the kids, it would be appreciated for them to evaluate what they can do to maximize the services they are being paid for. I absolutely did not respect one of the instructors putting my daughter on a time out during a class. He said she was too hyper and he didn't want she or any of the kids to get hurt so he put her on a time out to calm down. I understand that he was thinking of their safety BUT I didn't believe a time out was fair because honestly if they had been paying more attention they would have noticed her standing in line waiting to be helped for almost 10mins before she decided to have free play. And each time she went to another station she would wait for so long before getting bored. Can you blame her (or any other kid) she's only 4, five minutes to them is equivalent to 30-60 minutes. I am not upset about the time out itself, I do believe in discipline, I care that she got put in time out for entertaining herself due to the lack or organization by the instructors. Truthfully the class looks like 'free play' being monitored by instructors who only help them on the equipment...after they wait and wait and wait until one of them are available. They could improve their class by adding activities and games that relate to gymnastics and can help bring the class together as a whole. Also...I can't stress this enough...the instructors really need to engage with the children rather than just \"spotting\" them on the equipment. Fortunately I used a Groupon deal before deciding to register for regular classes. She has one more class to complete and then we will be looking into other gymnastic businesses.  I am exceptionally disappointed with the experience my daughter has had with this company. Fortunately she is only 4 so she doesn't know the difference, but she will absolutely not be returning.\n",

It was some special neither of us paid cover and it was $5 cosmos for ladies. The funny thing is my beer drinking BF ordered a Cosmo and received it for $5, maybe the waitress thought this funny or something, I sure did. Anyway, the music was out of sync between the two piano players, the kitchen was closed and it was only 10 or 11 PM and the guy playing the piano reminded me of a super annoying Joe Pesci with his dumb jokes. They embarrassed some drunk girl on her birthday with really vulgar stuff. I'm not a prude, in fact I'm pretty foul mouthed and minded, but if this guy said that stuff to me I probably would have knocked him right off his piano stool. We finished the only drink we ordered, payed our bill and booked it to The Yardhouse to enjoy the reverse happy hour and some beer.\n",
            "Original: Cover Charge Was Too Expensive. Drinks were very weak.  one of the piano players, Sam Ferguson... What a detroit punk... We had to pay him three times to get one request up and I am talking at 10-15 bucks a pop.  My advice to anyone going there is to sneak in a flask of whatever your drinking, DO NOT PAY SAM FERGUSON FOR ANY REQUESTS!  James Brown and Scott Doyle are the best.  Complain about the cover charge.\n",

            "Original: It's Saturday night and the bf's 30th birthday.  A group of us decided to head to The Shout House since it was fun the last time we went (Nov 2008).  This time, however, was not enjoyable.  We got there around 9pm and paid our cover.  We were lucky enough to find a table that was a good distance from the stage.   After about 20 minutes a waitress finally came over for our order.  We got a round of beer and water - the water never came and it took another 20 minutes to get the beer.  The place was not crowded so I'm not sure what the hold up was.   As we were drinking our beer we could not help but notice the table next to us: about half a dozen middle aged single women that were incredibly drunk and overweight that were grinding on each other.  Then the painist introduced an engaged couple - yet again a middle aged, overweight couple dry humping and grabbing each other on stage.  We all became disgusted and hurried to finish our drinks.  We all agreed to leave.  On our way out the birthday boy asked to speak to the manager - he complained about the waitress and then asked about a free birthday cover.  The manager said that if you let them know when you are in line then yes you can get in for free.  They do not advertise this so the birthday boy asked for a refund for his cover.  The manager would not comp him.  He stated that they do not give refunds.  This manager needs to work on his customer service skills.  It was his birthday afterall - why be a dick and lose business  I can't see myself coming back here ever.\n",

Major headache after a couple hours there.  Major.However, for those with not such great hearing, it would be a fun place to spend an evening.The service is horrid and the waitresses are slow and seemingly uncaring for the most part, but nobody will care if they are having fun I think.  I definitely wasn't more and more as  the evening wore on.If you don't hear so well as I seem to, you will just love this fun, enthusiastic place.I was there at the beginning of a Friday night until maybe 9pm.  I understand it gets more raunchy as the night wore on.  THIS was my mistake going there so early.  I'd rather get a few laughs from the raunchy cause early in the evening it was waaaay too tame for me, personally, but to each their own.A gal I know with meetup.com complained it was way too vulgar at the end of the evening.  She's been coddled, obviously, and was probably mortified if anyone said, \"poop.\"  So, like I said, to each their own.It was the constant loud noise that burned me out and not the bad service or the non-rauncy lyrics I heard.  This, I guess, is one of the downfalls of having better than normal hearing....crap!\n",

            "Original: I have been to piano bars all around the country, from Miami to Cali and back and this was by far and without a doubt the crapiest one!!  I genuinely like piano bars since they can be a really fun place to blow off steam while enjoying a good show; not here!!!!!!  Never a good sign that the place was pretty empty on a Saturday night the weekend of Cinco de Mayo and the Kentucy Derby, but nonetheless I and four other guests sat down.  I can easily handle the unstable tables or that all of the chairs felt like they were just about the break apart, I'm actually good with that.  I can even handle the fact that it took our waitress almost 20 minutes to just say hi as she walked by to another table.  I would even go so far to say I can handle the horrible tasting food, it's a bar right Your there for fun, not a gastronomic awakening!  What made this place the crapiest piano bar in the United States was the continuous Barry Manilow cover songs with an interspersed Elton John number- and they were horrible at both!  The drinks are VERY short pours, let me say this again since it bears repeating- THE BARTENDERS SHORT POUR YOU TO THE POINT OF BEING OFFENSIVE.  I went up to the bar (which was empty as well, I can see pattern forming here.....) and was met by a young man who was giving me the \"what the hell do you want\" stare.   I asked to have my martini look like a martini and not a  12 shot in a martini glass.  His reply was \"well that's what you get unless you pay for more\".  Holly crap, what a horrible place!  Here's the bill lowdown- 2 martini's, 2 Grey Goose mandarin and sprites- total bill-------- $72!!!  That's before tip (which they sure as hell don't deserve) or anything else since I paid for the burger with cash at delivery.  There are a ton of other great piano bars in the valley and there are some good bars in the Glendale area, just stay away from this shit hole.  I would bet $20 that this place is closed by the health department within a year, that is, unless it goes out of business for being such a disappointment.  DO NOT GO TO THE SHOUT HOUSE IN GLENDALE, AZ.  Chewing tin foil would be more fun than going back there.\n",

Why not take my wife and young son back to my old stomping grounds in Oakland and Shadyside  We've found that when traveling with a young child, staying at suite-type hotels (with at least some sort of kitchen facilities and a separate bedroom) is very useful.  The most convenient suite-type hotel to Shadyside is the Shadyside Inn Suites.  Unfortunately, since this business has a virtual monopoly on the area, it must believe it can put its clients up in deplorable, nearly unsafe conditions. These comments are based on our experience with the building on S. Negley Ave.  I believe there are at least two other buildings the hotel maintains as well as \"Mansion Suites\" which are reserved for VIP's or people staying for very long periods.General Complaints:1.  Exposed electrical and cable wiring (see pics).  We tried to spend as little time as possible in the room because I didn't want our 19 month old to inadvertently touch exposed wires.2.  Dirt.  Everywhere.  When we were getting ready to leave, I did a quick last run through the room to make sure we weren't leaving any of my sons toys behind.  I made the mistake of peeking underneath the couch.  Yuck.  Food remnants, dirt and debris from who knows how long under there.  Disgusting.3.  General poor maintenance of the building and its parking lot (see pics.)4.  The furniture in the rooms looks like it has been there for at least 15 years.  Our dining table was strikingly similar to the one I had in college.5.  No dishwashers.  Not unexpected given the age of the building.  But if you're not going to give your guests a dishwasher, at least give us sponges so we can wash our own.6.  When you check in, the hotel bills your credit card for the entire length of the stay ahead of time rather than vice versa (completely the opposite of every other hotel in this country.)  Keep this in mind if you want to leave early after seeing the condition of your room.7.  Three separate keys are required to get into the building and your room.  Again, completely out of date and not particularly secure.Also, the vaunted customer service that they crow about on their website must be limited to special guests and celebrities. 1.  When we asked for an extra blanket to be delivered to our room, we waited for over an hour with no response.  Ultimately, we had to drive back to the main office and retrieve the blanket ourselves.2.   The remote to the DVDVCR combo had no batteries in it.  I had to get the AA batteries from the main office (I didn't even bother to attempt to ask them to be delivered to our room) and had to wait while the office staff repeatedly found AAA batteries for me.  I was told the AAA batteries fit the flat screen TV remotes in the rooms.  I had to calmly explain that we did NOT have a flat screen TV in our room, rather we had a non HD CRT TV that was at least 10 years old. 3.  Daily cleaning of the room costs EXTRA.  Be sure to read the fine print.Perhaps some of its other buildings are more modern and in better condition.  Perhaps we had the worst unit in the entire complex... but I doubt it.Unless you absolutely have to be within walking distance to a business, client or family in Shadyside do yourself a favor and find a more modern, cleaner, safer and better hotel.

They move us, give us keys to a filthy room.  We bring that up and leave for the day for them to clean it.We get back to the room, and I check my bank account and find a significant amount of money missing - $329.  After spending about an hour on the phone with my bank, we trace the charges to the Holiday Inn I am staying at via the card that I have left for incidentals.Despite prepaying for the room, we've now given the Holiday Inn about $600 for a two-night stay in a $110  night room.Furthermore, the banks had closed so I couldn't transfer more money into my checking account until after the weekend.  It wasn't that I didn't have access to cash, but I had financial fraud to deal with on what was supposed to be a fun weekend with the guys.When I bring it up at the front desk, I am immediately given run around.  They pull up my info on their computer, and gasp as they see their error.  The staff wouldn't take ownership of their mistake, they simply blamed a computer error.  I finally get a manger who says he'll deal with the issue, and I don't receive any further communication, as I'm pretty sure he wasn't planning on working during the weekend.The next day of my stay I call the front desk again, and demand answers.  This manager was a bit more assertive in handling the issue.  She spent time on the phone with my bank, and then my bank conferenced me in as we searched for a way to overcome Holiday Inn's costly error.After dealing with this issue for about 5 total hours, it becomes apparent that there is no way my money will be returned until after the weekend.  I demand to only pay half of my hotel bill, which is immediately granted.  By then I was tired of dealing with the issue and took their bill reduction as adequate compensation.Ultimately, don't use a debit card to pay for incidentals on a hotel room, because hotel systems may automatically withdraw an egregious amount of funds from your account, which could cash screw you for the weekend.  Also, DON'T STAY AT HOLIDAY INNS because the staff and management is comprised of lazy, lying, and incompetent thieves.That is all.\n",

Also, there is a $15day charge for parking at this hotel.  The location is great, you can walk to pretty much anywhere, but it is very noisy even on higher floors.  We were mostly disappointed because we got a double room for Valentine's day and when we asked to for a king room, J.J. told us that we had booked online so we got whatever they had.  We felt like we were treated as second rate citizens because we had booked online.  Then when we got to the room, the faucet was so loose it fell over.  It was fixed promptly, but made a bad first impression.  Neither time my husband and I have stayed at this hotel have we had a good experience.

I'm a southern girl and make real deal, bomb-azz grits at home. The grits at Cajun Queen were those instant, \"add boiling water to reconstitute,\" grits. Culinary blasphemy.I will not return. If you want real grits, go to Mert's Heart and Soul.\n",
            "Original: So incredibly let down by this dining experience. Our waiter was simultaneously overbearing and absent-minded. Half of our table got their meals 10-15 mins before the other half and the waiter forgot to bring two of us our desserts. Meanwhile, the food was terrible. The fried green tomatoes lacked any kind of seasoning and the crawfish etouffee was bland and not at all spicy. The tollhouse cookie pie was also a travesty. How does one mess up a cookie pie! At least the key lime pie was good, but not worth the $250 dollar bill :(\n",

            "Original: DISABLED PEOPLE, PLEASE BEWARE I've been a patron of Cajun Queen for over a decade but my experience tonight was humiliating. I treated my sister to  a birthday dinner and despite our online reservation, we were asked to leave in  the most demeaning of ways. I have a debilitating childhood disease and use a wheelchair on occasion ; tonight was one such occasion. I could only order food I knew didn't require cutting, so I opted for potatoes and a salad. My sister ordered a full meal with wine. I had two mixed drinks (so we're not cheap diners). We had to signal for another glass of wine for my sister, despite seeing the party next to us being served appropriately. I'm not sure why we were overlooked but I'm left to wonder if it's the small portion I ordered that was disparaging.Anyway, when my sister went to look upstairs a minute to reminisce, our server asked my sister quite off the cuff, \"Do you want help with 'her' (wheel)chair I kinda need that table.\"Taken aback, my sister said, \"No.\" We took note of the EMPTY tables on BOTH sides of us and the fact that the restaurant wasn't crazy busy as we remembered. I spent $67 on a tab for two  and left a TIP of $20--clearly more than twenty percent.I don't know many people who tip as graciously as I  do. My reasoning for leaving the tip despite the service, was it being Christmas time and it's something I do for goodwill.When we rolled to the handicap ramp, it was completely (I mean, completely) blocked off by an A-frame sign about parking; see for yourself. Had  my sister not been with me, I would have not been able to access the restaurant at all.I haven't  always been disabled and ran a restaurant, myself (loved every minute of it). I know how people can take advantage (campers) and I know people can be uber-cheap at tipping. I don't fall into  either ilk. I know good service when I see it; I know how to approach diners who overstay their 'welcome (their can NEVER be anyone who overstay their welcome; consider it flattery); it's part of doing business and keeping patrons happy.  Take a loss here and there. We were in and HOME in a little over two hours. The couple beside us with the adorable little girl who  laid all over the booth was fine by me; she's a child and CQ is a noisy place. I felt a sting of angst when I asked for my food to be wrapped. The facial gestures were quite unsettling.Please don't tell me I'm sensitive: I've had over FORTY surgeries--TWO with NO painkillers afterwards. I've walked on a BROKEN leg to buy wrapping paper tape been accosted because I wasn't 'messed up' \"enough'\" to ''deserve a handicap tag.

What the heck  My friend's massage included an actual massage.4- the tranquility room is an open space right off the showers. there is no tranquil anything about this 'room'. No soft lighting, no blankets (I was quite chilly), no anything to make me feel I was in a special place to enjoy my quiet time.5- the pleasure of this experience, and i use that term kindly, cost me a whopping $175.

            "Translated: I was so surprised as to the level of disappointment I experienced at this spa. My best friend and I (she flew in from NJ for a visit and we planned a girls' day) went to this spa for 1 hour massages, both of us choosing hot stone. We both have experienced this type and other kinds of massages in many different places, NJ, NY, California to name a few.Here are my main issues:1- we are greeted by a very nice woman who does not understand or speak English. We ask questions and we are answered 'yes' every time. When we asked about the spa pools (are they hot or cold water) we get a 'yes'. I ask again, are they hot We get a yes.

            "Original: UPDATE: I mailed a letter to the spa director with our list of complaints. I was surprised when I received a phone call from the director. He wanted to discuss our experience and promised that they were in a transition, updating the spa, etc. He refunded our money and offered us a massage at no cost so that we could be impressed and change our minds about this place. We were looking forward to a great experience, as promised and I fully planned on updating my rating here on Yelp.So, I called last week to book our appointments only to find that the director is no longer with the spa. I left a message with the spa manager and after several days she has yet to return my call. I guess the good service left with the director.\n",

            "Original: It takes a lot for me to give a nasty review, and this place earns it.I was in town for a mini reunion - 4 of my friends from all over the US met here to catch up (after 20 years!).  I have lived all over the world, and appreciate spa's of all sorts and facilities....and always the main thing comes back to service.First, the greeting here was nice.  We had reservations for our treatments and confirmed at the desk then went on the tour. The facilities are wonderful.  Very posh.  Beautiful pools, indoor and out, and the spa was relaxing and comfortable.Now with posh places, they can often miss the point of actual \"treatment\".  But keep in mind I go to a Korean spa in Los Angeles and get an old lady to scrub me down like a little dirty kid so that my skin glows.  Still, I expect the actual treatment.So I had a massage.  Can't go wrong with that - right  Well....maybe you can.  I choose the only man on staff, as I like a strong massage.  I can honestly say that he spent more time adjusting my blanket a million times then he did actually rubbing me.  It was almost annoying.  I was ready to rip the blanket off.  I'm here for a rub down, not fluffy adjustment of the blanket and how it covers me LOL.  So whatever....When I got back I asked my friends if their treatments were nice.  All said \"ok\" and I had wondered if they just didn't know better or didn't want to complain.  One did complain.  She said that she didn't get the hot oil head treatment.  Oh that's sucky - because it is an add on service and costs a little bit.  But she really wanted it.  Well it's not missing it that pissed me off....it's what the lady told her.  She basically told my friend \"well I totally forgot and I don't have time....but what a shame cuz I do a really good treatment\".  Well if that isn't the biggest f-you ever  She should have taken the time to DO it!Then we go to pay.  Well....now here is the part that totally had me trumped.  Like I said, I've been to spas on every single corner of this earth, and never before have I seen this done.  They basically add a 20% gratuity.  They PRE add it.  Then they say to you \"well, if you feel you want to give them less, we can change it\".  WOW WOW WOW!  So are you really suppose to feel like an jerk and say they deserve less  So first my friend - she told them to take off the charge for the service she didn't get, then said she did want to tip less since the girl made her feel bad.  They said to her \"well you know the tip get's shared by all of us\".  Oh my Lord.  My turn.  I say to her, well I've never heard of this being done before and it's kinda odd to shove the gratuity down our throats.  We all would have paid it anyhow, but it's the fact that we are demanded to without knowing that leaves a bad taste in our mouths.  I paid and didn't fight.But then...there was a local man standing in line waiting to pay too.  He said to the girl...\"what can I bitch about to try to get a discount\".  WOW.  Is this really how these locals act  He didn't know our situation.  He didn't know how we were treated.  So my friend who lives there turned around and said something to him - basically to mind his own business.  The girl behind the counter LAUGHED.Oh no.  In the car, my friend called several times to speak to a manager.  They kept sending her to voicemail. She left two voicemails.  NO call back.You can have the prettiest little southern spot and posh trimmings, but the meat is your treatments and your service.  In my booked you failed on both.\n",

            "Original: I treated my mom and myself to Sea Pearl Facials, Bottoms Up Pedicures, and Luxury Manicures on April 1st, 2014, at the Spa. I have lived in the Ballantyne area for years; however, this was my first visit to the Spa at Ballantyne. Overall, we were very satisfied with every service we received. We were welcomed and had a full tour of the facilities upon arrival. I personally had Leigh for my facial, and she was amazing. She talked with me at length about my skin type, the products that would work well, and the experience was incredibly relaxing. I have had facials before, but this is the best one I've ever had. My mom was equally satisfied with her service, and said she could have stayed on the table forever. I had Choyoung for my bottoms up pedicure and luxury manicure. She was an expert, and sought to ensure comfort at every step! My mom and I had these together, and it was a great experience - relaxing, refreshing, and lots of good chatter. We had a beautiful view of the golf course, and were sipping complimentary Pomegranate Martinis during these services. I have not been doing a manipedi on a regular basis, but am considering adding this on a monthly basis. Choyoung was very welcoming, friendly, and efficient. The only part of our day that really irritated me was our checkout. After gathering our things from the locker room, we came back up to check out. My mother went into the shop to browse while I waited to pay. There was one customer at the desk actively engaged in a conversation with the man behind the desk. There was a woman behind the desk also, not participating in the discussion, but seemed like she was politely listening. She clearly saw us walk up, and my mother go into the shop. I stood there for a bit, expecting that since the other customer was actively engaged in conversation with the other staff member, she would respond but did not. I almost said 'excuse me', but given I do customer service for a living as well, I wanted to see how long she would ignore me. I continued to stand there, and finally she (Lindsey) greeted me. I must say she was the most cold and rude person I encountered at the Spa. She presented me with the itemized bill before charging my card with $700 in services and a forced 20% gratuity (I normally tip 20% and would have anyway, but it's nice for the customer to have that choice), and then focused back on the previous conversation while she was printing receipts. It was almost as if I was a bother to her. After I received my receipt, I started to walk into the shop, and I heard her greet the person behind me with a totally different attitude. After the fantastic service received from all of their services staff throughout the day, it was not something I expected at the end. It goes to show you that a borderline rude customer experience at the end can ruin the entire impression of a business. Additionally, I sent this feedback in e-mail to the Spa, and heard absolutely nothing from them...not even a 'sorry'.\n",

Maybe I'm spoiled by my shabby little nailsthreading place in New York, but Modern-Phillips Place charged me $70+ for what would be $30-40 in NY (compare business rents).

No consultation on the shaping. MEDIOCRE brow shaping with rows of sticking out hairs along the curve. She did that way too rapidly with tweezers (so I guess she can't really do the fine work of threading a brow). The edge of a properly shaped brow should be perfectly sharp but also natural as if it grew that way. Holes should appear to be filled in magically. My brows also now sit a bit unevenly on my face. She wears a magnifier and this may give her a peephole view that is inadequate to perceive the overall shape, but it should have allowed her to create a totally smooth edge and NO STRAYS.No pre-sanitation or post-care of the skin.A mark where she caught my skin in her thread.Plus, cold rude staff.\n",

            "Original: I came to Snail Motorsports with the intent to have 2 strollers powder coated and media blasted but unfortunately I ended up having to ask for a refund and not have them do any work. I was really upset by the whole situation because I was really looking forward to having some custom powder coating done by someone who has done numerous amount of work for my friends. Juan the powder coater has done frames and rims for several friends, so when I started asking around for who to take my items to everyone referred me to snail Motorsports.When I took my items to snail Motorsports I was first quoted $370.00 to media blast 18 items and custom powder coat 6 items. I thought that was a little high so they reworked the numbers and came back with $240, I still thought that was a little high but i agreed to have it done and I payed half up front and left the items. As i pondered about everything throughout the day, I decided to look over the receipt and do some math. I noticed that for a simple powder coat I was been charged $5 per item for a candy powder coat I was been charged $15 and for media blasting I was been charged $10. I then though to myself what if i got everything powder coated and some number crunching late it would roughly be $260 to powder coat everything could this be a $20 difference to have everything done I called snail Motorsports and explained to them what I had came up with and I asked if the price to powder coat all my pieces would be $260 I was shocked when the answer came about the price to powder coat 2 strollers would be $600.00!! What i was so shocked with that sticker prices that I just sent an email and asked for them to not do any work and that I would pick up my items.There is no way 2 strollers would cost $600.00 to powder coat its not 2 cars When i showed up the next day I was greeted by Juan's wife who quickly offered me back my parts, but also offered to get me another quote she came back with $480.00. While there was no explanation to why we would go from $240 to $480 if the pricing per item remained the same I just could not do business with someone who was so inconsistent in their pricing. I ended up calling several friends to find out if they have had similar experiences come to find out several friends explained how before Juan use to be someone who you could talk to and ask questions too. Now he is either just too good for people or he just doesn't have the time for them. That really sucks since some of my friends ended up telling me that they are sending stuff out of town to get done instead of having to deal with someone who has an ego.\n",

From hence forth, all mentions of Benihana are likely to cause anxiety in my usually calm heart.  I hate complaining like this. I really do. But sometimes, you just have to, ya knowTuesday evening I met a group of friends for a birthday dinner.  The reservation for our party of nine was for 7:00pm.  All but one of our party arrived prior to 7:00, but the hostess was curt in explaining that all party members needed to be present before we were seated, as our chef would be ready to begin meal preparation as soon as we were seated.  Fortunately, the final member of our party arrived shortly and we were seated at 7:05pm.  It was not until 7:40pm that first contact with our server was made. Without any apology for the delay she took our drink orders.  She (name withheld because I don't want to be rude) returned more than 10 minutes later with our drinks, but waited another 10-15 minutes after that to take our dinner orders.  As I was waiting I looked over at the table next to us, who were also clearly celebrating a child's birthday.  At one point the mother (I'm assuming) smiled at me and said, \"I hope you get out before midnight. We've been here over two hours.  We're taking our cake and getting out of here.\"Upon taking our orders, one of our guests explained that due to a shrimp allergy it was necessary to cook any shrimp ordered by our group in another area (a neighboring grill, etc.).  Our server said that she would have to ask the manager, who came to our table shortly thereafter.  When the manager arrived at the table my guest explained her allergy and his response was that it might be in her best interest to leave.  I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt that he meant leaving the table, not the restaurant, but I'm not certain of this. Following this recommendation he mentioned that she could wait in the bar as the rest of us dined table-side.  I asked him why it was not an option to prepare the shrimp at a neighboring table, but he expressed concern that other customers may require the use of the other available tables.  I understand his point, but the restaurant was near-empty as the hour quickly approached 8:30pm.  Finally, he offered to prepare the shrimp portions of our meals in the kitchen.  I'm not sure why this wasn't initially mentioned as an option, but I'll leave it at that.  Our chef Tom eventually arrived at our table. He was very pleasant and efficient during the course of our meal preparation.  During his time at the table my Emperor's Salad was delivered, as were the majority of my table's sushi orders.  However, two of our guests that ordered sushi were not served at this time.  In fact, they were not served until a full 10 minutes after the rest of our party finished our meals.  At one point, they inquired about the delay to she-whose-name-shall-not-be-mentioned, who responded that they were \"waiting for the rice.\"  When she delivered their food there was not a single mention of the delay.  Two hours and thirty+ minutes after we arrived at Benihana, we left.  From start to finish, the entire evening was a terrible experience.  It was ridiculous to the point that there was not even soap or toilet paper available in the restroom.  Were it not for the kindness and professionalism of Tom (and the awesome company of friends), the night would have been a complete waste.  My final thought is this. The food was fine, but because I was feeling particularly piggish on this Tuesday evening, I enjoyed two California rolls from my stash of Costco sushi at home before departing for the restaurant. The difference between Costco's rolls and Benihana's...a toss up - just sayin.  The good news is, this will give my friends something to whine about for YEARS to come...\n",

Told me to go the bar and ask the bartender. Really! Then the chef came out and was pretty good although cooked everything separate starting  with only onions and zucchini, where's the veggies From start to finish it was about half an hour! If we ate the dinner as a whole it would've been cold.. So we ate as we went. Also drink refills were a tough task too.. the chef had to keep asking other servers to assist. few and far between!! We had 3 birthdays at our table.. Not one song , which I didn't care, not one complimentary picture, no dessert was offered until another customer said something. Then the bill.. Oh the bill... That took another 15 mins!! At this point I told my family to go ahead home and I will wait considering this overall experience was almost a 2 hour ordeal. I was double charged on two items. At this point I was DONE dealing with this incompetent and appethetic waiter!!! Went to settle my bill with the manager who was nice and accommodating. Rectified the errors. And was generous with a $20 refund! I told him about the experience and all he said was \"I can take picture now for you\" UM... I was by myself!!! No thanks! One last thing, the male greeter needs some drug intervention.. He was high as a kite and made my daughter & I feel very uncomfortable to the point of invading our personal space and staring with those glazed over eyes as he staggered to and from his post.

            "Original: This is by the far the worst hibachi restaurant I have eaten at. The food is very bland from the onion soup to the fried rice (which basically was white rice with chopped onions) to the chicken (which was so pale it looked like it was boiled). Hibachi food typically has tons of flavor and tastes good because it has some grill marks and char, which none of our food had. I question whether it was even cooked on the hibachi table (we ate at a regular table but ordered from the hibachi menu). Not only was the food bad but the service was terrible. Our waiter didn't even know that hibachi dinners should come with the two sauces, he acted confused when I asked for them. Additionally, we ordered a sushi roll for an appetizer and instead of getting it before dinner, we received it after our dinner even though we saw it sitting at the sushi bar for a good 15 minutes beforehand. This restaurant may have been around for a long time but it doesn't even compare to other hibachi restaurants and was more expensive than any other I've eaten at.\n",

He also couldn't perform all the tricks that are pretty standard from Hibachi chefs.  The food. Not good.  My boyfriend ordered tofu and it was cold in the middle.  He didn't bother to have the guy heat it more, bc it would have just been a hassle.  The chef forgot one friends meal completely and got rude with the server.  Then after everything was cooked, he looked at me and asked did you eat all your shrimp. I replied \"no, you never served me any.\" (I had ordered the chicken and shrimp.)  He then sends the server back into the kitchen to get more. By the time they were cooked, everyone was finished eating.  Come on.  To make matters worse, when we left we saw that he was the head chef. That doesn't say too much for the rest of them. I don't know how people keep coming here.  There is WAY better hibachi in Pittsburgh, for a lot less money.  I mean honestly, I paid $9.50 for a glass of Kendall Jackson. No. The best part of the meal were the cupcakes that my friend brought.  Do your wallet and your stomach a favor and go to a different Hibachi place.  Benihana is not worth your time or money.\n",

            "Original: My family and I have been going to Benihana for about 5 years now. We've always had to wait at least a half an hour to be seated, even when we've had reservations. In the past its been forgivable, mostly because its close to home for us, the food is okay (albeit a little pricey), and my Grandmother absolutely loves the entertainment of hibachi. But that all changed last night when we went out with a party of 8 for my and my mothers birthday. I made reservations two weeks in advance for our birthday dinner. When I called they were almost totally booked and only had a few spots left that evening. Our reservations were for 7:30. We arrive a little early at 7:20 and I let the hostess know that we are there and she checks us in. Then we basically just wait and wait and wait. We notice the hostess turning people away, and we notice two tables who have been seated for about 30 minutes now haven't even gotten their soups or salads. By now its nearly 8 O'clock. Then my mother overhears the hostess telling someone that they are short staffed and the wait is going to be extremely long. By this point we've been waiting for 45 minutes. My sister takes a walk through the restaurant and notices there is only 1 hibachi chef working, but there are SEVEN tables seated, all waiting for fooddrinks. So I ask the hostess how much longer before we are seated. She informs me that it will be at least another half an hour before we get a table, because two hibachi chefs and two kitchen chefs called off sick. It would be another hour after were seated before they would even start taking our food orders. This is TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE. First of all, the hostess should have informed us when we arrived that they were short staffed and we would have a very very long wait. OR, the manager should have phoned people with reservations and asked if they could reschedule. Either way, we should have been informed instead of letting us stand in the lobby for an hour, not knowing that it would be another hour and a half before we would actually eat, on an evening when we had reservations. We decided to call Ichiban to see if they could accommodate us. They told us we could walk right in and be seated immediately. As we were leaving we ran into a gentleman who was outside smoking who told us that his party had reservations for 6:30 and they still had not ordered their food! It was now about 8:20pm. Our first dinner at Ichiban actually turned out to be much better than our previous dinners at Benihana, so I don't think we'll ever be going back there. I think Ichiban will be our new hibachi restaurant of choice.\n",

Either way, we should have been informed instead of letting us stand in the lobby for an hour, not knowing that it would be another hour and a half before we would actually eat, on an evening when we had reservations. We decided to call Ichiban to see if they could accommodate us. They told us we could walk right in and be seated immediately. As we were leaving we ran into a gentleman who was outside smoking who told us that his party had reservations for 6:30 and they still had not ordered their food! It was now about 8:20pm. Our first dinner at Ichiban actually turned out to be much better than our previous dinners at Benihana, so I don't think we'll ever be going back there. I think Ichiban will be our new hibachi restaurant of choice.\n",

I honestly gagged.It was so awful, we just stared at each other, amazed that we just spent our money on a pile of stinking rot. Determined to not waste everything, I picked up a piece of spider roll to sniffinspecttry. IT HAD A HUGE HAIR IN IT, all wound around the crab. Totally disgusting. My husband attempted to try the inari - just tofu and rice, right It tasted like rotten fish, as it had absorbed all the smells from the other fish rolls. We had also ordered a vegetable and tofu soup, and a green salad with ginger dressing. Can't even believe this, but the salad leaves were brown and slimy on the ends! They actually screwed up a green salad. The soup tasted like the inside of an aluminum pot, all metallic and burnt-flavored. Horrible, horrible, horrible. We literally dumped everything down the garbage disposal. Total waste.We tried to call and complain, but by the time our order was delivered, the place was closed. We will be calling again today to get our money back. Maybe they will earn themselves another star if they do the right thing and refund our money.\n",

Fried rice was...just not what I expected, not exceptional either. In short, I paid almost $40 for a cucumber roll and two bites of rice. Maybe this is better when you dine in.

            "Original: I went here with a social group for drinksmeal on a Thursday evening. We had the upstairs reserved just for us. The atmosphere was comfortable. The downstairs [outside of our group] was dead. The physical layout of this place is impressive. On the outside, it looks like a corner business. But its really a full restaurant with an upstairs area. Anyways back to the actual experience. They served food upstairs for our group, which was cool, but you had to put your credit card down as a tab. [Not an issue]. The bar selection is ok. The food was ok. The issue I have with this place is that when you go to pay out, they give you a post swiped transaction. This is the receipt that shows the total, card transaction details, tip, and total. They did not give a receipt detailing the full itemized service. After requesting the receipt and giving a quick look at it I paid, and put down a tip. After looking at the receipt later, it turns out that there was a gratuity charge already added to the receipt. I find this to be very deceptive and FRAUDULENT. Adding grautity to a bill doesn't bother me. It bothers me when 1. it was never stated that would be there, 2. when you don't have sitdown service with a waiter [the social group I was with was more of freeflowing in the bar area] To add insult to injury, they try to play the club vibe outside. They put up velvet ropes, and use a door man. There was no line, and secondly, giving an impression of an \"exclusive club\" is a joke when there is only a handful of people at the bar downstairs. Vibe: DeadFood: DecentDrinks: Typical selectionDrink price: $5 for a beer. [Mid range for downtown]Would I go here again No. Absolutely not.I've been to the ballantyne location twice, and I can't say that's a bad place.\n",

So don't act like you had it all planned out and under control.

Let me say I have absolutely no idea who the other 1-star commenter is. I am connected as a friend on Yelp with everyone I do know, and its sad that I have to defend that fact.

            "Original: My nail technician was Susan.  I showed her a picture of exactly what I wanted (short french tips with rounded corners).  She began the process and right off the bat was very rough with the manual and electric buffers, especially on my cuticles.  I have not had a manicure in 12 years so I couldn't remember if they were supposed to trim your cuticles or not or whether the process was supposed to be painful or not, which it most definitely was.  After some research, I now know they should NOT cut your cuticles, because if they nick and cause an open would with their un-sanitized instruments, you could get an infection, and a potentially nasty one at that (think staph, MRSA, etc.).  And she did cut mine open... on the side of two fingers, my middle and thumb, to the point they bled a little.  And apparently you should not see any existing white powder on the buffers they use on you, meaning they have not been cleaned or swapped out after each client.

            "Translated: My nail technician was Susan.  I showed her a picture of exactly what I wanted (short french tips with rounded corners).  She began the process and right off the bat was very rough with the manual and electric buffers, especially on my cuticles.  I have not had a manicure in 12 years so I couldn't remember if they were supposed to trim your cuticles or not or whether the process was supposed to be painful or not, which it most definitely was.  After some research, I now know they should NOT cut your cuticles, because if they nick and cause an open would with their un-sanitized instruments, you could get an infection, and a potentially nasty one at that (think staph, MRSA, etc.).  And she did cut mine open... on the side of two fingers, my middle and thumb, to the point they bled a little.  And apparently you should not see any existing white powder on the buffers they use on you, meaning they have not been cleaned or swapped out after each client.  The buffers she used on me (manual and electric) had a considerable amount of existing white nail powder on them.The charge was $30 and I gave her a $5 tip which I now know I shouldn't have and I really regret.My nails did not turn out looking like the picture I showed Susan.

            "Original: Okay, so my big beef here is not so much with this LOCATION of Bath and Body Works, but rather with Bath and Body Works as a company in general. Let me explain. For starters, I just want to say that this store is clean, well-presented and has some very nice girls working in it. The scents of candles and lotions are incredible, and they were hard to resist with their Fall displays front and center with names like \"Autumn Leaves\" and \"Cinnamon Pumpkin\". Their prices are reasonable and their gift items are very nice. (Sigh)...so here's why I'll never shop here again. I came in to check out the store and in my browsing around, grabbed a tester for a particular scent and gave it a try. I always like to do this with lotions and perfumes; before I commit to purchasing, I put it on and walk around with it for a few hours to let it soak in since it always smells different than when you first put it on. So I left the store and for the next hour could not stop smelling my hands - it was so good it was intoxicating. I don't even remember which scent it was, but that's not important anyway. An hour and a half later I was back in the store and heading for the counter, bottle in hand. So I'm reading the back. I'm trying to be ever so conscious about my purchases, especially beauty products, in that I only buy products that are paraben-free and NOT tested on animals. Call me uptight, but I just don't think animals should be tortured so I can smell like fake juniper. I scan the label and see that it does contain parabens, but it smells so friggin good I make an exception. Then I see it: \"This finished product not tested on animals.\" And for a minute I think, Great! Ready to buy. And then...this...\"finished\" product  What the heck does that mean Normally if a product is not tested on animals it will just say \"Not tested on animals\", or \"We NEVER test our products on animals\", or the like. And if it says nothing, you always assume that they do test on animals. But \"This FINISHED product\" So, the final product that fills the bottle in my hand, the one that I intend to use, has not been tested on any animal. But what about everything before that And then I just got mad. Very mad. Do they think we are idiots Some big shot at BBW must believe that their customers are totally mindless, lazy, and can be easily fooled by the wording they chose. I don't know what made me more mad; the fact that they do test on animals, or the fact that they take us all for idiots and try to play like they don't run the tests. Either way, out of principle, I put the bottle back and decided I will never again give a dime of my money to BBW. Excuse the rant, but this just really pissed me off.\n",

Jennifer hasn't the foggiest notion how to properly complete a man's haircut. She neglected to trim the sideburns, ear, nose, eyebrow, and neck hair, even though I asked her, to which she responded, \"We have people who do that!\" (for an extra charge!) and suggested I spend more money to have another girl wax these areas. WTF Are you kidding me here REALLY On the lighter note, I am getting a so-called complimentary facial. Definitely a place where you should prepare yourself to be accosted by staff to spend more money!\n",
            "Original: Worst pedicure ever. The polish bubbled and never cured properly. Besides making a mess of the job, the stylist lathered on a lot of artificial flattery and tried to pressure me to buy a bunch of unnecessary over-priced random products.  But all that I needed when I left this place was a new pedicure--which I gave to myself with some drugstore polish.  Never ever again will I go here!  Absolutely horrible experience.\n",

            "Original: I now understand where the name comes from. Yesterday I went into Dick's to buy my daughter some shirts. As we were checking out I noticed a bin that was full of bags that had sports watches and body bands to monitor vital signs. I started going through them to find a watch that would meet my workout needs. Most of the bags that contained these watches were missing something. Not a problem because the outside clearly noted what was wrong with the package. It said things like \" missing manual or dead battery\" I found a watch that was missing a manual. I went online and looked up the watch and it had what i was looking for. I purchased the watch as is and took it home. After trying to sync the watch to the body strap monitor for an hour, I went online and found that the watch that i have takes an analog strap and the one that was in this bag was digital. I went back to the store today to swap out the wrong band for the correct on. I was told that i had to speak to Nicole the store manager. I was directed to Nicole who was assisting another customer. After standing patiently waiting for Nicole while the customer and Nicole discussed trading in his older wife for two younger ones, I got annoyed. I went back to the counter to find a different manager. I was told that Nicole is it. I waited some more. After waiting for Nicole for 15 minutes and listening to conversation that had nothing to do with products or services she asked how she could help me. I explained the situation and showed her the online picture of what i was supposed to receive with my purchase and she told me that they take everything out of the original package and put them into the bags that they sell these in.   i pointed out that as people look through the bag,   watches are being mixed up. I showed her Timex watches with Polar band and bags with two watches and no bands. Some watches had no bags at all and were sitting in the bottom of the bin with other loose manuals and straps. After going through each bag, I could not find the correct band. Someone is walking around with a digital watch with an analog band. I asked if i could purchase a more expensive watch and just pay the difference. Nicole said no. I get \"as is\" but I purchased it because the issue that was advertised on the packaging was it was missing the manual. It did not say that the accessories in the packaging do not match and the watch can not be used for anything except time and date.Now I have to pay for a new band as well as pay for shipping which is going to be more expensive than buying the watch at the original retail price. Thank you for horrible customer service and a useless watch.Pissed of Morrison Family YMCA Soccer Dad\n",

Upon picking it up I realized that my high end pedals had been switched with some of the ones they use on their floor. I brought this up to the staff's attention who didn't hesitate in saying that I was wrong and they don't do that. I asked to speak to the manager an nobody was there from the management staff. I asked them to go review their security footage and they said they didn't want to do that either. I took this issue up their corporate ladder and all they did was apologized.I since stopped frequenting them. Sadly due to lack of options from a similar retailer in the areaI had to visit this location again recently, I had a backpack on as I rode there in my motorcycle. I walked in the store and started headed to the department I was needing, I was stopped by a rather unpleasant employee who told me I could not be in the store with a backpack due to recent theft issues. I told her that I had been in other dick's sporting goods and was never made aware of such rule. I also informed her that there was no signage stating that as I walked in the store. She continued to state that I could either give them my backpack or I could leave the store!!!!I told her that neither option worked and that she could inform her security staff to watch me on camera or have someone follow me around as I did not feel comfortable giving them my backpack which had my valuables in it.This brand has high prices and the staff isn't very knowledgeable nor very pleasant. They are definitely missing the point of retail on so many levels it's pathetic.I wish there were other options of stores similar to them in the area.\n",

Should have been a sign but we pulled up in the van and parked. There was a very large, foreboding looking guy hanging out at the front door. Hmmm.. We walked up and he looked at us like, what are these two white girls doing here We were wondering why until we stepped inside and every african american person in the building (which was all of them), swung around to look at us. It was, seriously, just like the old Westerns where the cowboy walks into the saloon and all of the crooks and criminals look up with daggers in their eyes. We stood there, for a hot second, a guy started hitting on my friend so I pulled on her shirt sleeve and we literally backed out of there.I could feel people staring at the backs of our heads as we left.Hmm.. maybe we were there on the wrong night.**For the record, because I'm sure someone will get offended...

I didn't have much of a problem with drinks, or service until later that night... and that's why I'm taking the time to give this place a 1-star review.This is a review about a certain bartender, whose name my friend and I never got, but he said he was Chinese and Colombian. The area seems to close down early.... even though there seemed to be a basketball game getting out. The bartender said he was closing up early, directed us to another bar (closed when we got there) hand we found a place nearby. Shortly after, the same bartender showed up at the bar, started drinking with us. I don't remember much about the conversation, except for some lies this guy was telling us, saying that he was running the bar after two weeks of working there, that he didn't live in Phoenix, he lived in New York - later, he forgot that he said that, and told us he lived in the same city in California that we did. By the time the bar closed, I was getting pretty sloshed, and he proceeded to invite himself to our motel room (I thought my friend invited him, and my friend thought I did), and by the time we got to my friend's car, he insisted I sit in the back seat. I'll skip some details here, and make a long story short:I puked on the ride home, so I spent the rest of the night sobering up. The ChineseColombian guy kept pushing weed and beer on my friend (who's a lesbian, by the way) and when you're a man, you can tell when a guy is being a sleazeball and trying to get into a girl's pants. It became blatantly obvious that he was waiting for me to pass out so he could do what he wanted, and so I forced myself to stay awake. Again, I'm skipping on a lot of detail here, because Yelp really isn't the place for that.After he had long overstayed his welcome (which was never offered in the first place), my friend went to the bathroom, and I mustered all the civility I had left to ask him to leave as nicely and non-offensively as possible. To this, he insisted that unless I reimbursed him for the pot and beer he brought (neither of which I personally imbibed) he didn't have to leave. I bit my tongue.Shortly after, I could hear him talking about me outside when he and my friend were having a cigarette. I snapped, had to get rude with him, pulled my friend inside and slammed the door in his face. The point of this whole review is this:Ladies, watch out for this sleazeball bartender. He'll try to get into your pants by the most disrespectable means.\n",

That has it's advantages if your main goal is to hold hands with lots of partners. I have certainly heard a lot of hype about Paragon but the studio left me kind of cold. I don't see how anybody could learn to dance there. The quality of instruction isn't close to other local studios I have been to. Of course maybe the instruction was better than I knew since it was almost impossible to see or hear the instructor and individual attention is out of the question. I gave them another try on a Thursday for a West Coast Swing lesson. The quality of instruction wasn't good, and we had distractions because other group lessons and privates were given in the same ballroom. They have other small ballrooms so there was little excuse to cram everybody into the main ballroom. I watched a private lesson and wasn't impressed by what I saw. Paragon is probably popular because of the dances after the lessons but the music wasn't for beginners. So, if you want to learn dancing go somewhere else, for meat markets do Paragon.

All around great day until we hit Bar Louie for some drinks and appetizers.I am giving it one star, though it deserves none, because our waitress was nice, if a bit inattentive, and the hummus app we ordered was pretty damn good. Outside of that Bar Louie leaves a lot to be desired.This is probably the first place I've been to where they charge $10 and up for all mixed drinks. To me, that is beyond ridiculous. Bar Louie is not an upscale restaurant, as much as they wish they were, and paying almost $60 for three drinks and two appetizers is insanity defined. As I mentioned the waitress was friendly, but she definitely did not come back and check on us enough. I really wanted to like this place because of things I had heard and the drinks we had were really damn good, but if it want to spend that kind of money, I'll go somewhere that I can get good service.\n",

Unfortunately, I cannot because the service was so bad that I left before I had the chance to order. We found seats at the bar behind the taps. After sitting there for 5 minutes and not being acknowledged, we thought that they might not be able to see us, and so we moved to a different pair of seats in the middle of the bar, grabbing a few menus on the way so we would be ready to order. It was fairly busy, but it is not like there were people standing at the bar trying to get drinks - everyone was seated and I'm sure they face much busier times. We sat in our new seats for almost 15 minutes (I timed it - I am not exaggerating), and were not even acknowledged. You would at least think the bartender would acknowledge us and tell us he would be with us when he could, but despite staring him down almost the whole time, we could not even make eye contact.

I ask why there isn't a sign on the door saying 'closed for private party', and I get a ridiculous answer that the \"CEO doesn't like us to do that\". How dumb is that: you leave your system open to make reservations and you don't alert people that might be going to a show on the north shore that the place is closed.

You know what a 'private party' sign does It advertises that you are available for private parties, and would have given me an hour to figure out other arrangements.\n",

My friends come in, we wait 10 minutes for someone who works there to talk to us. I tell her we have reservations, she acts like it can't happen, and that it's my mistake, she says that the place is closed for a private party. I ask why there isn't a sign on the door saying 'closed for private party', and I get a ridiculous answer that the \"CEO doesn't like us to do that\". How dumb is that: you leave your system open to make reservations and you don't alert people that might be going to a show on the north shore that the place is closed. The fake sincerity is what really got me. You know what a 'private party' sign does It advertises that you are available for private parties, and would have given me an hour to figure out other arrangements.\n",

            "Original: This place is another that is undeserving of your hard earned money!! The following is an email that I sent to the owner, it will shed a little light as to why I feel this way...I will also share his response, and what ultimately became of the situation. I know this one is long winded, but you should be forewarned about giving them your money!I have been to your bar many times, and I have had both good and less than average experiences, but this past Saturday was terrible! My girlfriend and I came to have some dinner around 9 pm. We knew it would be crowded due to the Penguin game, and that wasn't a problem. When we arrived, there were no seats at the bar or tables available anywhere. We decided to have a beer and wait. After the game was over, some tables opened up so we sat in an empty booth in the back and waited. After about 5 minutes, a waitress came over, cleaned our table, and made notice of the fact that we still had drinks. Sadly, this was the last time that she ever came to our table. We placed our closed menus at the end of the table...nothing, we put our empty glasses at the end of the table with the menus...nothing. We sat and waited for more than 15 minutes. All the while we were waiting, another group of four sat the table next to us, they were never given any attention. They got up and left after being completely ignored. I understand that the restaurant was busy, and that service and wait times may be impacted, but the way we were treated (or lack of being treated) was appalling. It was especially annoying to watch the server that initially cleaned our table giggling and carrying on with two other booths that appeared to be friends with her on the other side of the dining room and then when she was done she just casually walked over to another empty table picked up something off of it and went into the kitchen without even taking a look around the dining room. At this point we were disgusted and got up and left, I was annoyed and made mention of how awful the service in the back was to the doorman. The waitresses in the back were terrible and seemed to have no sense of urgency or seem to care about most of the customers, with the exception of the few tables that they were more interested in socializing with. This seems to be a problem, because on some of my past less than stellar experiences, the disappointment was again with the service from the back servers. On those occasions it was the same thing, they seemed to be more interested in being social butterflies than providing any sort of service. You don't need to improve your wait staff, you need to replace some of them, at least the people working the back dining room on this past Saturday, they were completely useless! Will I come back to your restaurant, I'm not sure. The food is good, but I work hard for my money, and I expect to receive more than good food in exchange for it. Sincerely, Matt K.Here is the response that I gotPlease give me a call (412)555-1212 to discuss the matter. I'm sorry & will make every attempt to make sure this doesn't happen again.Thank you for making me aware of the situation.Joey DeMarco I promptly called him as soon as I got this email. It went to voice mail , so I left a message. That was it, the guy didn't even have the decency to return my phone call. It is amazing that this is how business owners expect to keep people coming through their doors and handing over their hard earned money. Support local businesses, but make sure they are deserving of your money!\n",

What a lame excuse! Even your online menu says under the description for a Buffalo Chicken sandwich that its supposed to have both those ingredients - \"Served with lettuce and tomato on a fresh-baked Kaiser roll.\" - That's what the last line in the description of Buffalo Chicken Sandwich says. Shame on you Manager for lying! Instead of admitting her fault, she was blaming it to a new menu!Not only did we have to pay for something that we didn't order or eat, but we got sub-standard food that was different from what was described in the menu, and had to deal with a really bad waitress and insensitive and deceitful manager to top off the whole experience. I am never going to come back to any Eat N Park location ever again, and will never recommend one to any of my friends either. What a waste of time and money!

            "Original: I was really excited the day after new years to get a bagel with my best friends I traveled all the way from Milwaukee to see. Upon arrival, the place was pretty busy with people who obviously frequented the establishment often. We don't have many Bruegger's in Wisconsin so it was my first time here and it was not an enjoyable experience to say the least.It began by me placing my order and asking for my sandwich without the tomato spread. The worker actually interrupted me mid sentence to ask which bagel. I politely stated my preference and moved along. The older gentlemen working the cash register asked what we got. I said what bagel and my boyfriend also asked for 2 hazelnut coffees. The cashier responded with, K..... I asked okay and he responds with, I need to know what size.... I shrugged it off and was like well whatever maybe he's bummed to be working on new years.Then, when I get my bagel it has the tomato spread on it, which I politely asked for it without, yet was interrupted. The man literally says, \"Ma'am I don't know what you actually ordered and TOMATO is different than TOMATO SPREAD. Like I'm sorry... WHAT! the sandwich comes with only one kind of tomato.. pretty sure that's impossible to get confused with. I tried so hard to not say a big screw you too. He made a huge deal about the whole thing and if he wasn't so rude when we were paying I probably would've shrugged it off. I had too much pride though.THEN, he comes up to me and says MA'AM just so you know you were over charged because you ordered incorrectly. You shouldn't do that next time. K. Maybe if you took the time for decent customer service and realize we obviously have never been to a Bruegger's.And to put this into perspective, I worked at a breakfast place last year on new years day and not once did I feel the need to be that rude to anyone. It sucks but it's not my fault....\n",

The worker actually interrupted me mid sentence to ask which bagel. I politely stated my preference and moved along. The older gentlemen working the cash register asked what we got. I said what bagel and my boyfriend also asked for 2 hazelnut coffees. The cashier responded with, K..... I asked okay and he responds with, I need to know what size.... I shrugged it off and was like well whatever maybe he's bummed to be working on new years.Then, when I get my bagel it has the tomato spread on it, which I politely asked for it without, yet was interrupted. The man literally says, \"Ma'am I don't know what you actually ordered and TOMATO is different than TOMATO SPREAD. Like I'm sorry... WHAT! the sandwich comes with only one kind of tomato.. pretty sure that's impossible to get confused with. I tried so hard to not say a big screw you too. He made a huge deal about the whole thing and if he wasn't so rude when we were paying I probably would've shrugged it off. I had too much pride though.THEN, he comes up to me and says MA'AM just so you know you were over charged because you ordered incorrectly. You shouldn't do that next time. K. Maybe if you took the time for decent customer service and realize we obviously have never been to a Bruegger's.And to put this into perspective, I worked at a breakfast place last year on new years day and not once did I feel the need to be that rude to anyone. It sucks but it's not my fault....\n",
            "Original: Went to a High Tea here on Sunday.  Although the setting was lovely and the staff was welcoming, the food was nothing special, in fact, it was bad.  We were served three tea sandwiches:  egg salad, which was bland (I make a better version at home), chicken salad, nothing special either, and then a delicious spinach-artichoke bite.  Unfortunately, it was the size of a quarter, it was literally a bite.  But it was the best part of the meal!!!  (I don't think the size of all three of the sandwiches put together was as big as one piece of white bread).We were offered two types of scones:  cranberry and eggnog.   Neither was anything special, eggnog had absolutely no taste whatsoever!Then, the pastries:  we were served a gingerbread cupcake which was fine--nothing like Vanilla Pastry Shop!  A pumpkin torte, again, fine.  And a chocolate moussebrownie bite with a raspberry and candy cane on top--it was dry as a bone!  It looked as if it was on it's last legs--chocolate was turning white, mouse separated from brownie.  Yuck.  Oh yeah--I had a delicious tea from Harney and Sons (used to be sold at the Grand Floridian High Tea in Disney World), cinnamon spice!!!  Unfortunately, when I asked for more tea, they gave me new hot water and the same old tea bag! I've gone to various teas so I feel I can give a good comparison.  Not impressed at all!  Will not go back there, ever!\n",

Any local chinese buffet will give you shrimp for a lot less than that.2. My shrimp looked like long barrels rather than a shrimp shape.

The french fries were from a bag --frozen.Being from the East Coast, I know what fresh seafood tastes like. This is NOT it folks.

The bartender turned out to be also the waiter for us in the back dining room, which means we seldomly saw him. He wasn't exactly friendly, but I guess he got the job done at the minimum since he did bring us our beer and put in our food order and checked on us every now and then... but was a smile that hard to come by Do I really have to be a regular to get any friendly service Worst was the food runner... which we didn't know that's her only job there (not like they have waitstaff uniforms on for us to distinguish). So when a late comer asked her to take his beer order, she snapped back \"I am not your waiter!\"  WELL, thank goodness she wasn't our waiter with that attitude. More interestingly, this very same food runner had to deliver a dish to the corner table next to ours that was blocked in by 2 big tables (ours and another one). Instead of doing her job the right way and walk around the both big tables to get to the corner table, she just pretty much demanded my friend to get up & push in the chair, so she could squeeze by... how lazy and unprofessional was that! That pretty much set the tone for an unpleasant night for me.To add salt in a wound, besides Guinness that was on special at the bargain price of $4, Fat Tire was $5... I didn't think Fat Tire is that caliber of a beer. Food was pricey as well, $4 for a basket of fries but with curry sauce (which would be the only reason I order frieschips in an English pub) is $5, $14 for fish & chips and that didn't look like a huge order. They had more wings options than anything thing else... but if I want wings I probably would have gone to somewhere else. I ended up with $8.50 of blacken fish tacos. It was ok, the fish still had lots of liquid after being cooked, which didn't mix well with the slaw and tortilla wrap. I did enjoy the cup of soup as my side. In short, I echo the other reviewer: I'll go to Big Ben any day over this joint if I am feeling a British pub mode. At least they have better menu options, and most certainly better service.\n",

So the burger came back cold, slightly wet, cheddar cheese (not melted) on top of the old cheese. Disgusting. Absolutely disgusting. The server said nothing, even when he saw me not even take one bite. After approaching the manager, she took it off the bill. I am not saying that I need anything for free, but I did come there to eat, left hungrier than I arrived, and then STILL had to go through the chick-fil-a drive thru after paying $30 for 2 drinks and the meal of the other person at the table.Never again.\n",
            "Original: We went to the Avenue and it is not good.  The ham and cabbage soup was pure salt.  It might be nice in the Winter for melting the sidewalk, but certainly not a taste treat.  My partner ordered the fried walleye which was both bland and dry.  Completely flavorless.  I had the duck special which was also dry and bland.  The wild rice side was pretty good.  Overall this was a very disappointing experience.  Skip the Avenue Bar.\n",

            "Original: My friday night at Avenue Bar was one to remember. Not because it had the best food or the best service but because my visit proves you can't always judge a restaurant by ranking or reviews. I will not be returning anytime soon.  My goal in writing this review is not to bash on the Avenue Bar. you won't need to after you read my play by play of the night. 7:00-3 friends and myself arrive at the restaurant. We give our name and head to the bar being told it was an hour wait to be seated. Thank god basketball was on tv or we might have fallen asleep waiting.8:20-we are seated in the back room right next to the kitchen. We had the luxury of sitting in foldup metal chairs on at a pull out card table with a cheap plastic table cloth-not the cool wooden tables or a booth like in the bar room. I honestly felt discriminated against because we were 24 year olds. I saw no young people seated in the bar room and saw so many booths with two people at them I thought it was universal date night. Instead we were with \"our type\" in the back room receiving second hand service. My waitress spilled water on me while attempting to fill my glass and just giggled and put napkins over it. Haha are you serious Again, thank god there were big screen TVs to watch or I might have cried out loud. 8:45- fish fry arrives; soggy, greasy, and not very warm. Best part of my meal was the spotted cow and cheese curds for an app. 9:15-I feel sick and want to go to sleep. My night is over.Advice for anyone under the age of 30- don't eat here. Go somewhere fun where you are treated equally. Food and drinks-30 bucks. Gas money to get there-6 bucks. Never eating there again-priceless. Thanks for reading\n",

            "Original: Let me start off by saying I have mostly simple tastes, and my favorite lunch spot for Chinese has been the New Dumpling House in Squirrel Hill. But since that restaurant is undergoing renovations, I was forced to try something new.So... I thought I'd try the chain PF Chang's Chinese Restaurant at the Waterfront. Wow, what an unsatisfying mistake that turned out to be.I started with a cup of their Wonton soup. At $2.95 it wasn't too outrageous of a price, the broth had some flavor and there was much more in it than I was used to, including three giant basil (I think) leafs that covered everything beneath.

            "Translated: Let me start off by saying I have mostly simple tastes, and my favorite lunch spot for Chinese has been the New Dumpling House in Squirrel Hill. But since that restaurant is undergoing renovations, I was forced to try something new.So... I thought I'd try the chain PF Chang's Chinese Restaurant at the Waterfront. Wow, what an unsatisfying mistake that turned out to be.I started with a cup of their Wonton soup. At $2.95 it wasn't too outrageous of a price, the broth had some flavor and there was much more in it than I was used to, including three giant basil (I think) leafs that covered everything beneath. In the broth were chunks of chicken, two shrimp, some sliced water chestnuts and two \"pork\"-filled wontons.

Needless to say, that was left untouched.)Let's just say, not only did it take 30-40 minutes to get our food (for food that was of LESSER quality than Chinese takeout), the food itself was just utterly disappointing...

Not only that, they also didn't have BEEF CHOW FUN (ok, so whoever claims this restaurant serves \"authentic\" Chinese food clearly has no clue on what they're talking about).

            "Original: Another bad experience two times in a row. There must be a shortage of waitstaff in Charlotte because these people shouldn't even be working at Walmart. Both times we went for lunch and took an hour and a half. They served soup which took almost 40 minutes to get egg drop and it look like low tide in Louisiana. Big chunks of gray and black eggs floating in my egg drop soup, waitress looking at me like I was crazy. The manager came over to serve our food and asked how is everything I mention I was going to write a bad Yelp review and he said well thank you and walked away. This place used to have a long wait and now there's nobody ever there, now I understand why. Portions are small, service is bad and probably better off going to McDonald's.\n",

            "Original: I ordered take out from this P.F. Chang's on Tuesday night and have to say that is was terrible. Not only I was the food ready 45min later than the time frame they gave me over the phone, the food was soggy, underprepard and bland. For example, the Kung Pao Shrimp was not fried as it is supposed to be and doughy. My family always orders this dish in various locations and this was by far the worst. Delay and food preparations aside, what really sets me off is that I not only waited 45 min to receive my food (altogether the preparation time was well over 60min), I have received nothing from the management as an apology but plenty of negative attitude. Maybe I am spoiled but in every P.F. Changs I have been so far, I have received a credit on the bill or a voucher if something is off. This time I have received nothing (only a half hearted apology of the manager). in my opinion, if a customer waits 45min in the restaurant for a $110 pickup order made on the phone, prepays AND still gives $5 tip, I expect to get something off the bill. Here, however, I have received nothing.I will not visit this restaurant anymore and cannot recommend it. Sadly it has lost its game - maybe it was the Tusday manager.\n",

            "Original: Absolutely horrible experience. We were seated and drink order was taken by that person. Few mins later drinks were dropped off by a different person who said waitress would be over to take our order. Then 10 mins later someone came over and asked us if we wanted appetizers which we did and ordered Crab Rangoons and Spare Ribs. This person said someone would be back to take our order. Never happened. The apps came out and the guy said again someone would come take our order. So we ate our apps and still no one. No one even acknowledged us, I had to flag someone down and I said \"I think our waitress has forgotten about us...\" The man says \"what you want\" ummm to order Hes like \"Yes, what you want just staring at us, no smile or apology. So we ordered and got our food about 10 mins later. Had to wait forever for our check. I think we had a different server every time someone stopped by. The Crab Rangoons were simply not Crab Rangoons. There was no cream cheese flavor whatsoever. I am not sure what they were, but not what I was expecting. The Shrimp Fried Rice tasted ok but the Shrimps were full of poo. Not deveined and completely packed with poo. Just disgusting. Wonton soup flavor was good but the actual wontons must have had a teaspoon of ginger in them. Strong and not really what I was expecting in a wonton...Whole dinner sucked. To top it off there was vomit all over the womens bathroom floor. No idea why this place was full. Many great chinese restaurants around, this is not one.\n",

The food however was not. I ordered the general chicken with brown rice and an egg roll. The chicken was all slimy dark meat and the flavor was nothing like general sauce but rather 100% strong garlic. I wasn't able to even eat hardly any of it because of the brown slimy meat. My husband ordered the garlic beef and he did not like the sauce at all. It had zero garlic taste, was way too thick, and overall wasn't very good. The egg roll was soft and mushy and is a shrimp roll so not your typical chickencabbage type. The place was super busy and I had high hopes, but ultimately the food itself was not good and we will not be back.\n",

I also appreciate the fact that Fate is a downtown pioneer, and that one can eat there after 9:00.We've been to Fate a number of times, with vaguely disappointing results. After this visit -- we've had it. I'm not really high on the \"this happened when i went there one time so it must happen all the time\" style of user review. So, let me state that everything that happened on this visit has also happened during previous visits, yet never all at once. Fate, however, put it all together this time to deliver a really memorable fiasco. I don't know if Fate's policy is to have the hostesshost inform everyone waiting for a table that the wait is going to be fifteen minutes, but the math doesn't work out. The place is tiny. We waited forty minutes. The next group waited fifty-five minutes. The next few groups are probably still waiting, their once-vital bodies deteriorating into skeletons.The server dropped off some menus, mentioned that she was going to bring us some water, and then vanished as if she were an illusionist's assistant. Again, Fate is tiny, so the trick was pretty difficult.Anyway, we ordered after she rematerialized (after the required fifteen minutes). Stuff arrived. It was the old joke -- \"the food here is terrible... and such small portions!\"I'll spare most of the hideous details, but one lowlight to share involved the sesameshrimpsalad item. I'm hoping that the foul flavor and aroma was the result of some slightly-off fish sauce, rather than some slightly-off shrimp. Actually, why do I care We felt lousy afterwards and dosed up on the twin antidotes of water and mouthwash. Our cat still wouldn't come near us. Anyway, I don't mean to imply that the owner and staff at Fate are malicious. The food isn't good enough, and the experience isn't good enough.

It was fun!We parked and walked up and went inside.  The decor was nice. It seemed to have a decent atmosphere but I am not the type to be suckered in by all that crap.  If a place sucks, I don't care how chic the atmosphere is.  I will call a spade a spade.  The place wasn't full, quite the opposite really.  Maybe 2 or 3 tables were occupied.  So we go up to the hostess and tell her we'd like a table for two and she says that it'll be about 5 minutes which I am fine with but when I ask her if we can wait in inside she says \"No.  Please wait outside.\"  What the fuck is that about  I could understand if they were super busy and they didn't have any open tables for us to even sit at putting us in the way but if it weren't for the damn techno-look-at-me-I'm-cool music they were playing, you could hear crickets chirping in this joint.  Strike one!  So we go outside and wait.  She comes out after awhile and gives some other people that are waiting some drinks then tells us she'll be right back after she goes and grabs a couple of menus.  They must keep the menus in the parking lot or something because it took her awhile to come back.  She sits us in this corner that's pretty much hidden away from everything.  So here we are eating in a restaurant that I'm convinced people go to only to be seen and here we are not being seen.  Oh woe is me!  Woe, woe, woe is me!  However will I earn my cool points for the monthThe waitress was very nice and attentive.  I'll give them that but god damn could they keep this place any darker.  I realize it adds ambiance but when you're struggling to read the damn menu it's a little much.  Strike two!We order a couple of $4 Republic of Teas and the pot stickers then proceed to peruse the rest of the menu.  The variety is somewhat lacking and a common theme is sweetness.  As anyone who knows me will tell you, I don't do sweet.  So I order the Cantonese Dragon Beef and my significant other orders the Szechuan Chicken.The waitress comes back with the pot stickers.  They sucked.  They were identical to the ones you get at Costco.  They are just like the ones they serve at Casey Moore's during happy hour only there they're free.  Here they cost $6.  I eat one and that's it.  Strike three!Then comes the entrees.  Decent sized portions.  I can't really tell you if the presentation was good because it was so damn dark in there but I'll just give them the benefit of the doubt on that one.  Mine was in a word, crap.  The best thing you could say about it is that it tasted weird.  I didn't even like the mushrooms.  I am a mushroom fanatic.

I am beginning to think the baseball metaphor wasn't the best route to go as here we are already at strike four.  So in my disappointment I decide to give my girlfriends Szechuan Chicken a try.  Baseball was definitely not the way to go because we're at strike five now.  So now my only option is the white rice that came with the dish.  This thankfully was perfectly adequate.  Now if I go to a fucking CHINESE restaurant and the best compliment I can give the food is \"At least they didn't fuck up the rice\", we are in some ugly territory here people.

I took her to the ER this morning at 4:30 AM and decided to finally start posting on Yelp since I've been a lurker for a while.Aesthetics:Initially looks like a typical hipster restaurant like you might find in another city. Nice patio, cool inside.  However... The seating at a bus stop is more comfy. There is no chair back - just this high bar thing that digs into your back.I'm going to file this under aesthetics - we ordered the Hot and Sour soup (more on that later) and the waitress suggested it was large enough to share. However, they apparently don't have any kind of serving utensil, so we had to use our little soup spoons to serve ourself soup into another bowl out of this wide shallow terrine. WTFService:I don't know a nicer way to say it, our waitress was a dopey bimbo. It took 20 minutes for her to take our order. She went missing for long periods of time when I had an empty water glass, and then for a while longer after I tracked her down and asked for some. Not good.Food:I ran into a friend there, and he commented at how he loved the food and was surprised we didn't like it. To be blunt, it was utter crap. The hot and sour soup was thin and spicy. That's it. It tasted like chiles and a splash of rice wine vinegar- no other flavors present. It's not like any hot and sour soup I ever had.... in a bad way. There are these weird chewy dumplings like things in it that would be better served at protecting the floor from your chair leg. I ordered some Saigon basil something or other dish with beef, she ordered the Lemon Grass whatever with tofu.My dish was bad. The beef was sliced thin but tough and chewy, and totally lacked flavor. As for basil, there were 2 small basil leaves in the dish, and that's it. The sauce was thin and one dimensional. Her lemon grass dish was also bad. The sauce tasted like Tom Yum paste from the chinese grocery store mixed with some water. I felt bad for the poor abused tofu.I'm not a big fan of chain restaurants.... but Pei Wei and Pickup Sticks are about 10x better in terms of food quality and taste. Screw that, even the chinese place in the mall food court is better. I am not exaggerating. It was a very disappointing meal.Now for the nasty part.I drank water - Fiancee unit drank th 'Green Tea.' It was like no other green tea I ever had seen. It was leprechaun green, with some kind of milk like substance in it.I thought it looked kinda funky, but she drank it.It was the only difference between our meals. I tried hers, she tried mine, etc. I didn't drink the science experiment tea.Well... Several hours later she started having stabbing stomach pains. She spent the whole night up vomiting and with diarrhea.  2 days later the vomiting has subsided but she's missed 2 days of school and is still pooping up a storm. I took her to the ER at 4:30 AM this morning and they confirmed the symptoms were consistent with food poisoning. Admittedly she had just gotten back a 45 days ago from a trip to a 3rd world country where she got (and recovered from) a tropical disease so her immune system is not at it's strongest right now, but come on. This shouldn't be the end result. Plus this IS downtown Phoenix so there are plenty of people around with compromised immune systems, if you know what I mean, due to lifestyle choices.There is some great Asian food in Central Phoenix. Maxim and Da Vang are great Vietnamese places on 19th ave.The Cultural Center has a few great places, esp Golden Buddha. Thai Lahna has been consistently good for years.Like I said I don't eat a lot of chain food - but even the Pei Wei at 7th ave and McDowell is way better in terms of food quality.\n",

            "Translated: Stay away. Far away.I had been hearing about Fate for a while. I had high expectations, since I had been to Lucky Dragon in the past (the owners prev joint) which was OK.It was the worst ChineseAsian I've had in AZ, the service was terrible, the chairs uncomfortable, and to top it off my fiancee got food poisoning.... and has been sick for the last 2 days from it.

O.k., so I ordered the Thai Spring rolls, which had a filling of lettuce, a single strip of carrot, and noodles.  Seriously!  Main course, I ordered the curry, which turned out to be the worst curry in the world -- I don't even know if it was curry; it was more like a bowl of thick, yellow soup, with a few pieces of chicken and a couple of vegetables tossed in.  Yuck.  And then they only gave me a tiny bowl of rice.  I'm sorry, isn't it supposed to be the other way around  My friends completely agreed with how bad the place was (I think they had some sort of stir fry, which they said was bland and pointless).So yeah, I don't recommend this place.  Instead, head a block over to The Roosevelt for some good beer on tap and some pretty good food.\n",

            "Original: I hate Fate!  My fate at Fate has always been to have a mediocre meal that takes too long.  Don't even bother with a group as it only makes the servers even more surly than normal and the food even slower to arrive.The last time I was there, I was with a group (bad idea, per my comment above).  Several folks asked that their food be prepared mild.  When the food came, every dish on the table was nuclear hot.  I can handle hot food, but this was on par with Los Dos Molinos.  When we mentioned this to our server, she told us that it all has to do with the peppers they have on hand at any given time.  She patiently explained that the heat levels of the peppers vary (Duh!), but the chef always uses the same amount of pepper and never tastes the food.  Therefore, the heat level varies wildly and there is no consistency.  Frankly, any chef who doesn't taste their food needs to get out of the kitchen and into another line of work.The concept of the menu with the various preparations and the choice of proteins is great.  Sadly, Fate falls apart in its execution.It's a lot less flashy, but you get a consistent meal at China Chili where they also know how to regulate the heat in their food.  Apparently their chefs actually taste their dishes.\n",

            "Original: First of all, Johnny Chu should be ashamed to call himself a chef. He is barely a line cook. As stated in previous reviews, he doesn't even taste his own food (which accounts for the wide margin of variety a single dish may have on two different visits).So, I made reservations, thinking I may be able to sit at the bar because I arrived 10 minutes early. Wrong. I was ordered to wait outside. Nearly 45 minutes later, and a drink at the bar next door, I inquired about my table. The girl didn't even look up at me to acknowledge I had said anything. After a minute or so of staring at her while she continued to ignore me, she finally said my table was ready. Hmm.The food is horrible. I fear those of you who enjoy it, rather enjoy the \"atmosphere\" and come here to be seen. The food is either completely bland (e.g., my curry, which tasted of water with a slight hint of something I couldn't even recognize) or so hot as to mask any possible flavor. By calling themselves \"authentic Asian\" cuisine is just silly. There are so many hole-in-the-wall Asian restaurants that could cook Chu under the table blindfolded.So, the rude, nonexistent service, the insanely overpriced food, and to be seen is what you're paying for. If you enjoy being treated like shit and fed food that I wouldn't feed in a troth for pigs--you may enjoy this place and good for you!\n",

He stopped by to check if we needed to refill the green tea in couple of occassions but never did it until in much later time.  When we asked to split the bills in two in certain way, it had to be done three times.

            "Original: The food is average to slightly above average. That isn't what is wrong with Cherry Blossom.The problem with Cherry Blossom is the service which seems to be getting worse. I have taken my family there at least a dozen times and it appears as if the service which was so-so to begin with has deteriorated to just plain incompetent. Today was the final straw. My wife and I arrived there at 11:35 am for an early lunch and while the place was not empty, it was not packed either. We were seated immediately in the back room which was empty when we arrived. The server promptly took our drink order and brought it to us. She said she'd give us a few minutes to look over the menu. A few minutes went by, then another few minutes, then another and by 11:57, our order had still not been taken. At that point, my wife flagged down the host who took our order. I should point out that both my wife and I had ordered two simple lunch items from the menu without any substitutions or special requests. Two minutes later (around 11:59) our server appeared and asked if we had decided what we wanted. After informing her that we just gave our order to the host, she vanished. Both our orders were supposed to come with soup and salad and still by 12:14, neither had arrived. At that point, more people had arrived and the several tables in the back room where we were had become occupied. We also noticed that these customers, who arrived well after we had, had been served their salads, soups and even their meals while we sat there waiting. At that point I went to speak with the host about where our missing salads and soups were and she smiled politely but did not respond. My wife and I decided we were not going to pay for such incompetent service and just walked out. The last time I was there, the service was slow and they did not bring one of the salads for one of the meals we ordered. Other times we have gone there and waited 10 minutes to even be asked for our drink order when the place was not even half full. It just seems to get worse and worse at Cherry Blossom.So in conclusion. If you enjoy sitting and waiting while watching other customers who walked in 10 or 15 minutes or more after you did get their orders taken and served their food, this is the place for you. It is my belief that management is to blame for Cherry Blossom's poor service. Fortunately, I can take my money and spend it elsewhere and that's just what we did after we left. Cherry Blossom will not be getting any more visits from us.\n",

            "Original: This place made me wanna start a bad-food-diet! Ok. Maybe I should start a little more positive.This place has decent ambience. That's about it. The restaurant staff that I encountered was non-friendly, non-welcomy, and probably non-existent!The biggest offense is the food! I cannot believe so many other reviews were soooo positive. I came in a little late (9:15 p.m.) and that may have rubbed the waiting staff wrong, but there were 2 other parties that came in after me.Going back to the food. I ordered Miso Ramen and an addition of cha-shu (pork), and a side of Agedashi Tofu. 1. The Miso ramen came with a slice of salmon.  Really Salmon It was not the best combination to say the least. Miso There was hardly any miso in the soup. It was so diluted, I almost had to imagine the taste of miso. BTW, the cha-shu was like left-over and an after-thought added to the ramen. I am guessing the owner is trying to pull a fast one.  2. Agedashi Tofu. This is a freaking joke. An insult to the patron of the restaurant. Really!! How lazy can this restaurant get! Essentially a silken tofu deep fried with some dashi-based sauce. What did I get A re-fried chinese firm tofu which was probably microwaved with a bunch of undercook or recooked vegetable tempura. The sauce Dilluted straight from the bottle tempura sauce!3. Iced Green Tea. This one is not as bad as some other Asian fusion restaurant. They actually used a decent roasted green tea with a hint of roast barley.  Unfortunately, it is so very dilluted.  The guy from the next table was complaining that he was drinking water!I also saw something not very nice; a waiter recycling butter from a table.  I know it is sealed but, really in front of customersThis place really cut corners in terms of food and service. Benefit of doubt Maybe, since I tried this place only once, but once is enough for me. I saw 2 sushi rolls ordered by a couple that came in after myself. Not impressed at all.Bottom-line, lazy effort at best. Worst case scenario, cheap food costing big bucks giving patrons food-poisoning from re-using left-overs!\n",

The fried pork was so over cooked I couldn't chew it. The cold noodles were indeed cold, as they tasted like they were cooked 3 days ago and stored in the fridge. And the miso soup Me so wished it was good, as I was starving when I left.\n",

Walked in and saw some Asian people so thought it was a good sign. The bad: Ordered chicken karage and ramen - chicken karage looked straight outta the freezer section at your local supermarket! If you haven't had good chicken karage, it's fried (chicken, duh) with a batter similar to tempura (lighter than traditional American batters). Nope, this was your standard frozen, then warmed chicken with a rubbery-coating-that-passes-as-real-fried-food. If I wanted frozen food, I would have just made it myself (no I wouldn't, that shit tastes terrible). The sauce was uninspiring, but hey, does it matter if the chicken isn't worth it The ugly:  The ramen I ordered came out... and disappointment abounds. First, the noodles looked like what you buy at the supermarket. So... yeah, if I want supermarket food, I'll just go to the supermarket. Am I wrong to expect restaurants to actually prepare food from scratch Oh but it's so hard to make noodles by handmachine you say THAT'S WHY I SPEND MONEY IN A RESTAURANT!!!!What about the broth The life-sustaining broth that is cooked for hours if not days and ties the entire dish together ... well let's not get too excited because once again, it tastes more like powdered mix. Are we sensing a theme here Lots of supermarket stuff, at a premium price. Sorry, that's not why I go to a restaurant.So why did I even bother trying this place Because Yelp had promised me a grand culinary experience (okay maybe not grand, but good at least). This was really sub-par at best; the nicest servers or prettiest backdrop cannot make up for low-quality food. But I am a temporary tourist in Phoenix (4 months for work, normally in SF), so take my ran with a grain of salt. Maybe all that big city living has made me a (ramen) snob; YMMV\n",

Our server was very friendly & even though it was busy, we were greeted at the door & sat quickly. Unfortunately, it was downhill from the point we got our food. We ordered an assortment of rolls & a dish of pad Thai. The sushi choices almost all include cream cheese &or tempura, which made it difficult to choose a variety without everything tasting similar.The sushi all tasted fishy. I don't think it was unfresh, but it certainly didn't taste fresh either. It was somewhere in between the two...if that is possible. The presentation wasn't bad either, but the overall experience was tainted by the poor tasting sushi.\n",

The other reason the store looks so terrible is because its a mess (empty and disorganized shelves)!

Lastly, our cashier wasn't friendly and seemed like she was being in convinced by having to ring up customers.  For these reasons I generally go to Hobby Lobby or wait until I'm on the other side of Charlotte to go to a different Michaels.\n",

For a moment I felt how Robert Smith must feel whenever he walks into a Hot Topic, or Hulk Hogan in a bandana wholesaler's. But alas, like Torrid and Guitar Center, I inevitably showed up the same day as the token asshole employee whose brief interaction with me would ruin my view of this establishment for all time.While waiting for the show to commence, Fenyx and I went through the back door to take a smoke break, as were a lot of other people. The back door couldn't be shut all the way or it would lock, forcing you to either bang on it until someone heard you over the music or walk around to the other side. So he and I are just standing around, smoking, talking, making sure nobody shuts the door, and out comes the DJ. He steps out, and before even lighting his cigarette, slams the door behind him.\"Awwww, man, now you've locked us out,\" we say, playfully.The DJ stands over Fenyx, eyeballing him as he responds with \"Yeah, that's the point. To keep the undesirables out\" before walking off with his cigarette.\"What the hell just happened\" I ask.\"He thinks we're a straight couple.\" I laughed. I searched for a pen. I'd been mistaken for a lot of things in the past, but this was the first time I'd been mistaken as straight. This had to be documented. Fenyx, who is also not straight, was not as amused.I tried to brush the comment aside and we went back inside, where the DJ proceeded to stare down my amigo and I from across the bar. I knew at any moment, a confrontation would escalate, and I was forced to choose between leaving early, missing the drag show, or watch the tension rise to eruption. One of these scenarios carried with it the slight risk of me breaking a newly manicured nail, so naturally, I opted we go back to the Bunkhouse and play darts.I'm sure giving them 1 star for this one incident is petty, but, uh, so is what they did, so it works out, I guess.Oh well.

Anywho, walked in sat down I was excited to try the ponzu & goma sauce the prices for the meat was decent but what I didn't like about it was that it did not taste fresh. The meat tasted & looked like it was bought from a grocery place and then they just placed it really quick onto the plate and made it look nice. The goma sauce was so sweet and the texture of it sucked I tried to add in as much items as I can to take the sweetness away, seemed like they bought that from a grocery store also. The ponzu was okay not bad thats probably the best thing there ...

Firstly, the sukiyaki and dipping sauces were way too salty and just not appealingly flavored. Secondly, the chicken was in chunks, not sliced, and had all sorts of cartilage and chewy bits. The chunks wouldn't cook because they were too thick.. The chicken was completely inappropriate and also tasted bad because it was served marinated in some sort of sauce that neither of us liked. I just couldn't eat the chicken at all. My companion ate it just so we wouldn't waste it, but he didn't like it either. The beef was ok, and sliced appropriately, and I ate that in the shabu shabu, but without a good dipping sauce was ultimately just disappointing. I like cabbage, but they served way too much of it and not nearly enough of the other vegetables or tofu or noodles.The minor problem was the hot pots. They were extremely shallow, and the waitress didn't pay attention to them, so they were constantly boiling down, and at multiple points were down to almost nothing, so we couldn't cook our food.I left hungry, and sad.\n",

            "Original: I was not impressed. I have to agree with the 1 or 2 star review where someone said whoever is giving this place good ratings has not had real shabu shabu.The place was plain. The first thing I noticed when we sat down was that they had condiment settings that are normally used for things like chili sauce filled with what looked like grated ginger or garlic, scallions, and onions. I said to my boyfriend that these could've been sitting out all day. I glanced at a table to the left of the bar and there were a bunch of these condiment sets sitting there, probably never used since they took 'em out of the fridge because no one comes here (it was pretty dead). Hmm.Next, I was looking at their menu and I was fairly disappointed. Everything just seemed to cost so much more than it should've. When the waitress came to take our order, my boyfriend told her what we wanted, but she turned to me and asked what I wanted. My boyfriend was like, \"We're going to share.\" I started to wonder if the portions were supposed to be for each person. If so, then I felt like everything was overpriced. When we got the food, we were able to share it just fine (though my boyfriend ate most of it and I am hungry now, a few hours later). At the end of the meal, I still felt like we overpaid. Our meal was $23. If we hadn't split what the waitress implied was supposed to be a meal for a single person, then it would've been too much, imo. We just had hot pot at this great place in Rowland Heights, CA (called Kingswood Teppan Steak House, if you're ever in the area) and we had way more food and broth (two kinds, too) for $32. We had two different kinds of broth, four ingredients (chicken, beef, mushrooms, vegetables), and there was fried rice for each of us. Since it seems we split a single meal, we only got one bowl of white rice. The $9 difference would've only gotten us... I think probably just the side of chicken (it was like $6.95 or something) and we would have a couple bucks leftover that wouldn't have paid for anything else. I wasn't happy with the prices.As I mentioned before, it was pretty dead when we got there. After finishing our meal and reading the reviews, I was not surprised. I've had hot pot before, but this is my first time having it in Las Vegas. I'm hoping better places exist. I may just have to start having hot pot at home when I get cravings.I can't recommend this place nor do I ever plan on coming back.\n",

The food was decent, but stay away from the blue crab, unless you bring your own claw crackers. They don't have them. No one comes to bus your table. The one point, they left a bussers tub on the floor by our table, which we used to dispose of our used dishes.

He seems lost and unsure of the menu. Then said we had the option to do the lunch or dinner menu. Stating lunch menu did not include appetizers and the dinner menu includes 4 appetizers each. We wanted to do lunch because we only wanted two appetizers. He said OK then a moment later came back and said we could only do the dinner option. He rarely check on us and looked high. Totally upset that we wasted $40 on broth that tasted bland and possibly old. The high light of our meal...my water. The appetizers were actually better then I expected. They were the 2nd highlight of our meal. Maybe we just got a bad server. Whatever the case. Not satisfied. Should have went to Yama Sushi like we planned.\n",

The bad part was it was supposed to be all you eat  but then they gave me a menu that said you could only order 4 items ,i was surprised but i looked at the pictures and saw cute little appetizer things i ordered  4 items. When it came i was really shocked the things that came did not resemble the pictures and instead of three pieces i got two pieces  .

They get one less star because of lack of correct business information posted here as far as business hours, and BBQ hours. They also seriously need a website. This is an aweful business practice, and they could be making some serious improvements. Businesses need to be on top of these basic and fundamental things!!

I could not relax to enjoy my experience. With a few tables filled, did the music need to be so loudOn to the menu and service...We had originally come to try this famous rice ball everyones been talking about, and possibly get some little vegetarian BBQ sides, similar to yakitori. When I mentioned the word \"yakitori\", the waitress dressed in Japanese garb was like \"what u say\"... ok right, this is Chinese owned ChineseHong Kong restaurant... she was nice. She priceeds to tell me that the BBQ menu is only avail Thurs - Sat. What! You guys seriously need to update your yelp info!! I already missed eating here once cause your hours are posted wrong, and now I sat there unable to try what I came here for! :(In my observation service was not very efficient or quick. Service was slow as I observed in general. It was not busy, so I couldint understand why our server was not more attendant.We had ordered a sake bomb to share, and no second cup was brought out... had to ask.The food itself was great. I always order vegetarian things, so I was happy there were an item here and there was. I had a terrific eggplant dish that itself deserves 5 stars. We also shared the tomato vegetarian hot pot. Lighter in flavor than others I've had in my life, it was still yummy. It said there was supposed to be lotus root in there. When I told my server there was none, she was like \"oh really Sorry.\" Nothing to correct the situation. We shared it. Its made for one. And it comes with a choice of two dipping sauces... they sucked. See in LA, you get all these sauces at the table for FREE and they are authentic and damn good. I could tell they Americanized the dipping sauces here. :(Over all, slightly dissaponted. And just wish AZ had a really bomb and authentic hot pot experience. Hong Kong hot pot that im used to feeds four cause the pots so damn huge, and its like $15-$20. For one pot here its $10 +. :(We were finished with our meal for a good 10 min, and began to gather our things before she noticed to give us our check. Where did our free ice cream go that everyone was raving about We did not get any. :(I see where everyones been confused about this place. Its Japanese decored, but Hong Kong style food.

We first went to the Zebra lounge for a while to wait but the lounge was closing and one the hosts said that since they were closing they recommended the Laguna.  We went and only found one table open which that empty glasses from who ever was sitting there before.  We sat down, and stayed there until sometime past 2am (when the lights went on and the music stopped) and still those glasses were still there.  I think were were here for at least a good hour and none of the waitress ever stopped by to ask for a drink.  I went to the Bar as there were 3 bartenders one was serving drinks, the other cleaning some glasses and the last one I have no idea what was doing.I walked to the first guy, and as soon as I approached the bar, he walked to the other side and I just there for a few minutes looking like an idiot.  I then walked to the other end, and he walked back...no I looked like a bigger idiot as he was just cleaning glasses.  The lady in the back walked away so there were only 2 of them now.

            "Translated: I was not happy one bit here.  Earlier that night my girlfriend and I were waiting to meet up with a mutual friend at the Palazzo.  We first went to the Zebra lounge for a while to wait but the lounge was closing and one the hosts said that since they were closing they recommended the Laguna.  We went and only found one table open which that empty glasses from who ever was sitting there before.  We sat down, and stayed there until sometime past 2am (when the lights went on and the music stopped) and still those glasses were still there.  I think were were here for at least a good hour and none of the waitress ever stopped by to ask for a drink.  I went to the Bar as there were 3 bartenders one was serving drinks, the other cleaning some glasses and the last one I have no idea what was doing.I walked to the first guy, and as soon as I approached the bar, he walked to the other side and I just there for a few minutes looking like an idiot.  I then walked to the other end, and he walked back...no I looked like a bigger idiot as he was just cleaning glasses.  The lady in the back walked away so there were only 2 of them now.

I know its the strip and am willing to pay extra for drinks so when I ordered 4 Jameson gingers and it came out to 60 bucks I had no issues. However, sorry im standing at a bar and it took you 30 seconds to pour the 4 drinks, im not going to tip 20%. I signed the check and left a 5 dollar tip (I usually tip a dollar per drink at a bar) and today I see a charge on my debit card for 72 dollars....... First time this happened was at a bar by the pool a few months ago. take pictures of the check you signed people because they are dishonest at the palazzo\n",

            "Original: I have never been treated so rudely as I was at Narcisse.  But let me start from the beginning.  My husband and I went there for drinks after dinner on Saturday night and at first I was shocked that they made everyone wait in line when there was clearly plenty of room inside.  Secondly, it was odd that there were two young children around age 7 or 8 working the door along side the doormen.  I assume they are the owners kids, and they were adorable kids, but the last thing I want to see at a barloungenightclub on a Saturday night are children.  BUT, I can get over that- no big deal.  Once inside I ordered one of the least expensive glasses of champagne for $10 and  I noticed later on the receipt that they charged me double for.  Again, I can get over that.  My husband and I were enjoying our night and before leaving we decided to check the patio out and walked out the side door and walked towards the entranceexit so we could leave.  As we were making our way to the exit some guy came up to me said 'This is a private party' and I had no idea why he was saying that to me- the first thing that entered my mind was 'why are you telling me that'  Then he went on to say 'This is a private party and you are going to have to leave.'  Um, what! There were no sighs or anything at all that indicated we were suddenly in a 'private' area.  We were 5 feet from the door.  As we were leaving the doorman asked us if we had a good time and we said as a matter of fact, we were quite offended that as were were simply walking around and heading to the door another patron took it upon himself to tell us to leave.  I suggested that if an area is designated as a private party that they should have it marked as such.  He said he agreed that it was very rude and that I needed to tell his boss who was 2 feet away.  So I repeated myself to who I assume is the 'head bouncer' and his response was 'well, maybe you two should leave'.  What I couldn't believe the words that were coming out of his mouth.  He clearly doesn't have a clue about customer service.  And from reading the other reviews I am certainly not the only person that was treated this way.  TERRIBLE service!!!!\n",

            "Original: When I heard Bad Boy Bill was coming to The Mint in February, I was ecstatic. Problem is, this place has no dance floor. How do you invite one of the all-time great DJs to a place without a dance-floor Just plain stupid. Management has explicitly said on Yelp they are \"not a club\" and I can understand that, but they should probably just stick to the regular Top 40 if they don't have a dance-floor. In my opinion, just a bad look on their part. I will be driving to Vegas for XS to have a real party to which The Mint cannot supply. Nor do I plan to give The Mint a fourth try. They lose my business.\n",

I walked in with 2 friends and was not even acknowledged by the hostess.  We had to ask for a menu and were rudely handed them.  We asked for a table and she said to seat ourselves so we did.  We were promptly given waters by who I believe was a buser.  We asked to order drinks and he said our server would be right with us.  After 30 minutes we gave up and left. Our server never came.  We asked multiple people where they were and the answer was always that they would be right there. I was appalled that this happened.  I was looking forward to testing this brunch out.  Service is important and The Mint has terrible service.\n",

We ordered their sizzled shrimp (7 to be exact) which soaked in a dish of sauce, this dish could have been much better had they added rice to this twelve dollar item which would probably cost them little to nothing to add. Instead, you have to pay for a tiny side of rice. The sliders were an asian slider which was soaked in a rice bun. The meat on this \"slider\" was full of gristle and had tons of lettuce. Last, we were still starving so we ordered dessert. LOL - Let me tell you, we ordered their goat cheese wonton. When they say, \"wonton\" they mean ONE! The wonton was the size of a quarter and that was it! If this place wants to strive during the week, they need to add a great HH menu and put more food on their dishes. A huge disappointment!!\n",

Jesus Christ, I was finding everything alright the first four times you asked me, now be a good little retail monkey and leave me the bloody hell alone so I can shop and eventually give you my money!I'm sure it's this economy business that's to blame, and not necessarily corporate nonsense, but someone needs to take their manager out back and explain that annoying the piss out of your customers may actually be worse than ignoring them. And it's just this store! I went to the T-Bird location and wasn't bothered. Someone casually asked me if there was anything I needed, and I said \"No\" and was done with it. But at this store, I was literally asked three separate times by the SAME IDIOT if I was finding everything okay!Perhaps it was the annoying tunes they had playing that added to the grating atmosphere. Censored Rap (Not that I'm a fan, but hearing the song go silent every five seconds to omit a blatant swear is fairly tiresome after awhile) 70's Funk and bad Butt Rock seem to be on the menu ad nauseum. Though, in fairness, perhaps it's just the staff during the morning or something. I notice at night it gets a bit better... if you can crawl out from beneath all the employees asking you if you're doing okay long enough to even notice.I've never gathered the courage to stand in the line of leering meth addicts at the Trade Counter to tell you whether they give decent store credit for used stuff, though, so I'll leave it to greater minds to judge that facet of their business model. I will say that their used stuff is in good enough shape... if you don't count the bleeding stickers they put on absolutely everything! You inevitably spend twice the time you would have spent actually listening to your purchase doing nothing but peeling tape and stickers. They're worse than Gamestop, that way. I payed for it, it's mine. Why are you putting your ugly stickers all over my albumBad neighbourhood, too.I hate to sound so negative without balancing out with some positive, but the experience is fairly fresh in my mind as I just went earlier today. I guess their prices are good, unless you want something newish. In which case, bending over and having plenty of lube handy is the best advice I can offer.Just know what you want. Go in. Get out. And for god's sake, avoid their overzealous employees as if they were landmines.Or just give the constant irritants a pass and go to a different location. Or Bookman's. I know I will.\n",

If not for it being restaurant week, thus having reduced pricing, I might have 'made a scene.'So I'll start with a service review since I can sum it up with one simple fact: 2 hours and 15 minutes into dinner (restaurant week I remind you - simplified menu, 3 courses) we were still waiting on stuff to be brought to the table.  The service was atrocious and incredibly slow.  At the 2 hour and 15 minute mark, we finally just flagged down the waitress, told her to box up the food, box up the desserts that hadn't arrived yet, just so we could finally get the heck out of there.  Initially I thought this was part of the \"Blue experience,\" but its not.  The waitress came by every 30 minutes, took the order for the next course, and it took an hour for each course to come out.  So the food is boxed and i come home, nightmare over, right  Wrong! they boxed up my friends food and gave it to me, boxed his up an gave it to the 3rd couple that was with us, etc, etc, etc.  So NOBODY went home with their own food.  I love my friends, but I'm not nibbling at their food scraps.  So, food, how was the the food  Not quite horrible, but not quite good either.  Edible is a better word for it.  I got the \"Grilled Niman Ranch Pork Rack Chop - with a Tuscan white gigante bean and kale ragout finished with a sweet Italian saba.\"  sounds fancy, eh  Well, it was basically lukewarm vegetable soup, with a hint of chef boyardee, and a dinky pork chop dropped right in the middle.  It was so boring and bland, i question the chef's competence and would openly challenge him to a cook-off if this is as good as he could do.  I could walk into a grocery store blindfolded, randomly grab something, bring it home and microwave it for 3 minutes, and I would still like my chances.  Nobody at the table was impressed with anything they ordered.So let's circle back for a second, and return to service.  The waitress was very nice and knowledgeable I have to say.  Maybe she was just over capacity  I don't know.  But she recognized our frustration and had the manager bring our to-go boxes to us and apologize for the delays and long waits between courses (I think).  This is how that conversation went:Manager: \"hey guys, sorry things took a little long, you know uh, restaurant week and the kitchen got backed up.  But how was everything\"Me: \"Well, it was ok.  some things were pretty good i suppose, some better than others.\"Manager: (blank stare)Me:  (awkward moment)Manager; \"well sorry again, and uh i mean, you know ehhhh....\" (blank stare).Me: (still awkward so I'm just going to stand up now and leave).Manager: (blank stare and walks away).needless to say, I will never come back here again.  If it were free, I would probably still pass.  If asked what could they do to make it right, i would respond with a full refund of the entire dinner, plus compensation for the 2 hours and 30 minutes of my life that I'll never get back.\n",

I never tasted such an overwhelming orange dish in my life. Nothing had any other taste except orange zest. I had the duck, which was okay. Nothing to write home about. The duck was really rough & fatty. Came with a side of asparagus & rice. The veggies & rice were okay. I preferred them over the duck. For dessert, we ordered the cheesecake to split. We didn't even finish it. Would definitely NEVER go back\n",

            "Original: I am sorry to be writing this review.  My first visit to Blue a few years ago was fabulous.  The service was very good!  But, this time not only was the food not impressive, but it was totally boring! The calamari appetizer was good, but not worth $11.00.  The hummus appetizer was 2 golf ball sized clumps with almost no flavor.  Not even arranged to be appealing to the eye.  My tenderloin was nothing to write home about and the risotto was a mushy, tasteless ,  glob with Carmelized onions on it that looked reheated...also not  flavorful.  The baked in house bread were blah, and butter was not offered.  It could have used it to help the taste.  Dessert was the same...an amaretto cheesecake that tasted like it was left in the oven way too long....dry.   I love good food.  But, this evening was an utter disappointment.  It was a birthday celebration, and I did not want to spoil it with complaints about the food.  I also think my guest did not want me to feel bad for bringing them to this place I raved about prior to going. Service was great, but the server talked me out of a couple of things I considered getting.  Made me think whomever was doing the cooking that night...A Saturday was not good at certain things.  Extremely overpriced.  Btw...coffee was $6.50.  C'mon now!  Good but not that much!  Sorry, but I will not go back.  I was sooo looking forward to this special evening,  and it was an utter disappointment.\n",

The restaurant was not that busy - took 20 minutes between courses being served.  Needed to ask for plates for the muffins.  Ordered the filet with eggs - the eggs were burnt and broken.  The server never should have brought that plate to the table.  I expect this from Denny's at 3 am - not a restaurant with these menu prices.  My boyfriend had the tomato bisque soup - was Ragu in a bowl - even same consistency.  Another friend had the bananas foster french toast - even the bananas were bland.\n",

Strangely rude and almost demeaning, saying it was a waste to send it back.  The pizza was slopped together the first AND the second time, and I don't even trust what they did to it in the kitchen.  Yes, this is the feel I got from them, being our server, Zach and the other man whom I believe to be the bartender or the manager.

His manager then came by our table to tell us that we, the customers, should be aware that pizza is always served with mozz cheese.

When I told our server he said, \"I won't smell it because I don't like to tell customers that they are wrong.\" I was so shocked by his response that I did not order another drink.  The server took the glass of wine back behind the bar, and we then saw the owners and bartenders trying the wine and rolling their eyes.  Later, the server returned and told me I could order any drink, not just something off the happy hour menu, (wasn't sure if it would be on the house or not) and then never returned to take my order. When we finally tracked down another server, I ordered a sangria.  The server gave me a blank stare and said they did not have sangria even though it was plainly listed on their drink menu.

            "Original: Our weekly Empowerment meeting creates around lunch. It seems we are forever looking for a place that has good prices and a quiet place for us to brainstorm and raise our energy. We have stumbled upon Duck and Decanter. Finding this restaurant is only half the battle, the other is where the heck the front door is. I felt I was intruding on the outside patrons, only to realize I had to meander through, taking a glimpse at what they were devouring to get to the front door, an added bonus I suppose. Opening the front door to a happily buzzing place seemed like quite a treat. To your right is small wine area, to the left were barrels and stuff. A bit confusing, but basically it is like walking into a deli shop of olden days. I had no idea what I was doing. I stood in line and squinted at the barely visible menu of an array of deli meats, smoked meats, salads and more. Of course being gluten intolerant one can hope she has hit the conscious jackpot..but not today...I will just have the insides..no bun! But wait! I see smoked duck and wait..I can order the sandwich of my choice and have it made into a salad. Well that is a great compromise! Of course to know me is to know I am gunna ask a lot of questions, my main concern, does the smoked duck use nitrites, nitrates or any of those other nasty carcinogens. Rather shocked by the question, the gentleman serving me has no idea and had no intentions of looking. Damn! I was really hoping for the duck! I quickly go with plan B as I weigh nitrites or high fructose corn syrup and soybean oil..with that it was the tuna salad. You can not pay for your meal in advance as the idea is to meander the store..so I did. there were barrels of tea and coffee ready to be ground at your request. I was not impressed with the coffee grinder on the floor-ewwww. There was also an espresso area but it was not operational. There are gadgets to buy for your kitchen, and packaged condiments and foods that I presume they make fresh there. There are fountain drinks , bottled drinks, good assortment of water and non alcoholic beer, and loads of sugary add ons within tempting reach right at the cash register-brilliant! And there is not tempting this fort Knox (well the rice cripsy treats looked..nooo must...resist...I get my food, pay and go up stairs. There are different levels and two places to sit outside, which makes this place even more interesting. I open my package and there right on top are two pieces of bread stuck to my tuna. I read the entry for the Entree salad and it said nothing about adding in the bread. I ordered the salad due to the fact I can not tolerate gluten. Too hungry to care, I peel off the bread and I dive into my food and I am shocked at how awful it is. What is that mushy stuff I think it was water chestnuts in my tuna salad. Who puts water chestnuts, (if that was what it was) in their tuna salad I was unimpressed with the fact that the tuna salad was put on a bed of spring lettuce (which is a thumbs up for this nutritionist), some sliced celery and string cheese. Cheese! Who eats cheese with their tuna The tuna itself was extremely dry and too salty for my liking, and I had a tough time getting it down, and eventually I got so turned off I did not finish it. There was no dressing and no taste.  I ended up not eating the salad either. What a waste of  $10.00 including guilt tip! At least the company I was with was fantastic! Some restaurants ask you if you have been to their establishment before so that they can have the opportunity to give you the best experience possible.

            "Translated: Our weekly Empowerment meeting creates around lunch. It seems we are forever looking for a place that has good prices and a quiet place for us to brainstorm and raise our energy. We have stumbled upon Duck and Decanter. Finding this restaurant is only half the battle, the other is where the heck the front door is. I felt I was intruding on the outside patrons, only to realize I had to meander through, taking a glimpse at what they were devouring to get to the front door, an added bonus I suppose. Opening the front door to a happily buzzing place seemed like quite a treat. To your right is small wine area, to the left were barrels and stuff. A bit confusing, but basically it is like walking into a deli shop of olden days. I had no idea what I was doing. I stood in line and squinted at the barely visible menu of an array of deli meats, smoked meats, salads and more. Of course being gluten intolerant one can hope she has hit the conscious jackpot..but not today...I will just have the insides..no bun! But wait! I see smoked duck and wait..I can order the sandwich of my choice and have it made into a salad. Well that is a great compromise! Of course to know me is to know I am gunna ask a lot of questions, my main concern, does the smoked duck use nitrites, nitrates or any of those other nasty carcinogens. Rather shocked by the question, the gentleman serving me has no idea and had no intentions of looking. Damn! I was really hoping for the duck! I quickly go with plan B as I weigh nitrites or high fructose corn syrup and soybean oil..with that it was the tuna salad. You can not pay for your meal in advance as the idea is to meander the store..so I did. there were barrels of tea and coffee ready to be ground at your request. I was not impressed with the coffee grinder on the floor-ewwww. There was also an espresso area but it was not operational. There are gadgets to buy for your kitchen, and packaged condiments and foods that I presume they make fresh there. There are fountain drinks , bottled drinks, good assortment of water and non alcoholic beer, and loads of sugary add ons within tempting reach right at the cash register-brilliant! And there is not tempting this fort Knox (well the rice cripsy treats looked..nooo must...resist...I get my food, pay and go up stairs. There are different levels and two places to sit outside, which makes this place even more interesting. I open my package and there right on top are two pieces of bread stuck to my tuna. I read the entry for the Entree salad and it said nothing about adding in the bread. I ordered the salad due to the fact I can not tolerate gluten. Too hungry to care, I peel off the bread and I dive into my food and I am shocked at how awful it is. What is that mushy stuff I think it was water chestnuts in my tuna salad. Who puts water chestnuts, (if that was what it was) in their tuna salad I was unimpressed with the fact that the tuna salad was put on a bed of spring lettuce (which is a thumbs up for this nutritionist), some sliced celery and string cheese. Cheese! Who eats cheese with their tuna The tuna itself was extremely dry and too salty for my liking, and I had a tough time getting it down, and eventually I got so turned off I did not finish it. There was no dressing and no taste.  I ended up not eating the salad either. What a waste of  $10.00 including guilt tip! At least the company I was with was fantastic!

            "Original: So, I've been going to this place for years, not bc the food blows my mind, but rather it hits the spot. Plus, I love sitting on the patio drinking wine when the weather is nice with my best gal. Anyhow, my other best gal, my mom had never tried this spot. I  thought Duck would be great for a quick casual lunch. She's a vegetarian so we ordered the Where's the Beef sandwich to share. It took about 20 minutes to make the sandwich, which feels like an eternity when your hungry.When I glanced at the sandwich I thought perhaps they had added some portobello mushrooms to it. Turns out, the dark brown layer was actually rotten avocado. REALLY!!!! I mean come on! Avocado is like prime rib to vegetarians. How can you F this up It was truly nasty. It got me to thinking, if someone actually put this into the sandwich, what else would their low standards allow them to place into an unsuspecting victims sammie. It's not like they make them with blindfolds on. I was really grossed out.When I brought it to the manager's attention, she didn't seem that bothered by it. They remade half a sandwich for me, and that was that.It was annoying bc I left feeling that Duck & Decanter takes for granted the fact that loyal customers will stick with them no matter what. Well, not this one.Plus, that place needs a serious dusting. Yuck.\n",

            "Original: Food poisoning for two, please...I am really confused by all the 4-star and 5-star reviews for this place. The 4-star average Yelp rating was the reason my wife and I chose to dine here during our stay in Phoenix. Yelp, you really let us down this time.So I was on company business travel in Phoenix the week of March 12th and my wife was traveling with me. We had a French impulse that Tuesday night and tried to crash Petite Maison in Scottsdale, only to find out that reservations were required and there were no tables available. The following night, still craving French cuisine, we decided to stop in at Sophie's French Bistro in Phoenix.The first warning sign was that the place was entirely empty during peak dinner hours. However, encouraged by the strong reviews on Yelp, we decided to go ahead and order. We took advantage of a couple of happy hour specials and ordered the following...3 Cheese PlateChef's PateCalamariCrispy Duck BreastCreme BruleeThe food was average at best. My wife and I both tend to critique food as we eat it, and we both found ourselves commenting that the portions were small and the food was overpriced for what it was. Most of what we ate was bland and the pate had a very odd flavor and consistency.The fun started about 4 hours later when we were back in our hotel room. We both started experiencing various internal moaning and groaning, followed by the onset of stomach pain. No big deal, I thought... By shortly after midnight, we were each fighting for time in the bathroom, taking turns to vomit up everything we had eaten that night. I'll try to spare you the details, but this was the kind of violent and uncontrollable vomiting that I have only experienced perhaps once before in my entire life. Needless to say, diarrhea was also involved.After going through this for a good two hours, my wife and I were both thoroughly exhausted and dehydrated. My wife even told me she felt like she was dying, and said that she had never felt this bad before - not even during child birth. o.OSo by around 2:30am, my wife was begging for me to call an ambulance. For a while, neither of us could get up off the floor to reach the telephone. I eventually found a break in the vomiting and managed to sip down enough water to recover slightly. I carried my wife out to the car and asked the hotel receptionist for directions to the nearest hospital.We drove to John C. Lincoln Hospital on Dunlap, which I recommend if you ever get poisoned by Sophie's French Bistro. I managed to get there without hitting anything, which was remarkable since I could barely see straight and could barely function at all. Once inside, my wife completely collapsed and was unconscious briefly. The nurses and doctors rushed her into the ER and brought her back around. They gave her a shot of morphine and then hooked her up to an IV drip of fluids. As I waited, I continued to experience vomiting and tried to keep myself hydrated. Despite being in a hospital, I was determined not to check myself in for treatment, not wanting to add further medical bills.Sometime around 5:00am, my wife was ready to be discharged. The official diagnosis was acute food poisoning. We were never able to identify the specific meal at Sophie's which poisoned us, as we both shared the same courses and ate equal amounts each.However - and this is the kicker - when the doctors asked us where we had eaten dinner and we told them it was Sophie's, they remarked \"oh, that place!\". We learned that the ER at John C. Lincoln has seen 3 other cases of food poisoning caused by Sophie's. The hospital took our information for the purpose of compiling a complaint against Sophie's with the AZ Department of Health Services. They told us that once they have at least 10 confirmed cases, then they are required by law to report the incident as a disease outbreak.This all would have been nice to know before we chose to dine at this place. I can only assume that the other poisoning victims either don't use the internet, or are still laying in a pool of vomit somewhere, too weak to write a review.Please, please, PLEASE don't put yourself through the same hell that we went through that night. After this experience, we lost all desire to dine in Phoenix ever again. Thanks, Sophie's, for ruining our trip.For the record, we did have an excellent meal at CIBO Pizza the night before we were poisoned. I highly recommend CIBO. Great food, without food poisoning.\n",

Thumbs up on all of these yummy appetizers! The clientele is a hip, diverse crowd reflective of its gentrified, charming neighborhood of mid-century ranch homes, and yet just a hop from the Biltmore and Arcadia neighborhoods. Ah... Phoenix is growing up! Wish I knew more about wines to tell you more about that. It appeared to be a nice selection and there were bottles you can buy to take home as well. Parking is a challenge, however I will definitely be back.http:www.postinowinecafe.comUpdate: Postino's is one of many restaurantsbars in AZ that permits concealed weapons without permits and is noted on the Arizona State Rifle and Pistol Association in their CCW Cafe page: http:www.asrpa.comccwcafe.html For that reason I am reducing the previously 5-star rating to 1-star.\n",

            "Original: I won't even venture to guess why so many people like this place. But a few notes: no, it is nothing like a European cafe; no, it is not an actual wine bar; yes the service absolutely sucks.We came here for a friend's birthday party. Her mother had arranged ahead of time for 10 of us to be there and to have wine brought to the tables and poured and some appetizers brought out while we were waiting for the guest of honor. But before that, let's start with parking. You can't park in the residential streets because you need a permit. Fine. I heard they had a valet and there's nothing on their website about parking so, whatever. I head to the valet who asks me if I am dining at Postino's or La Grande Orange. I say Postino's and he says \"Ok, that's $3.\" I asked if they seriously were charging me for valet parking based on which restaurant I was going to and they wouldn't answer. I asked if there was an ATM since I had no cash and they told me there is one but it doesn't work. I got back in my car and drove around looking for a place to park for about 15 minutes. Fantastic.When I get there, about 6 girls from the party are standing at the front waiting for someone to notice them. Finally, a very unfriendly gentleman pointed to two tables and said \"Those are yours. Those other tables where people are eating are also yours but they're not done yet. We told them when they were seated they needed to be done in an hour but they're still there.\" Ok, so now we only have two of our four tables. Great. Finally they seat us at our two tables. Another unfriendly staff member comes over and plunks down a few wine glasses and asks if we want a glass of temperanillo. She pours one of the girls a random taste and then walks away. Upon her return I asked if this was the wine we were supposed to have because it was a Malbec. She argued with me about that for a few minutes until I pointed to the label. She said \"Oh\" and walked away. I never did find out if we were supposed to have the Malbec.At this point, the other two tables had been cleared. No one brought any other glasses or put the tables together, so we did it. Also, no one opened the other bottles, and yes they were screwtop, but still. So I opened them. Finally, everyone else arrived. We still only had 4 wine glasses. After trying in vain for several minutes we finally managed to flag down the unfriendly woman and asked for more wine glasses to which she responded, rudely \"We don't have any more.\" and walked away. I had to ask three different rude, uninterested staff members for wine glasses and managed to finally get another few but still, not everyone ended up with a glass. Seriously Anyway, the bruschetta came out. While the menu offers a lof of different ones, they are all so deplorably bland and under-seasoned that they felt unfinished. The fig, marscapone and prosciutto should have been good but the poor pig that gave its life was disgraced. Dry, flavorless. Most of the bread pieces weren't even cut all the way through so we were all man-handling the pieces to get them apart. The bread was obviously just grocery store bread and I doubt anything is truly hand-made. The issue is, the quality of their ingredients sucks. They obviously buy the cheapest grocery store crap they can and then mark it up. Everything, even the apples on one of the bruschettas were lacking in any real flavor when they should have been tart and crisp instead of dull and mealy. And as for a wine bar Seriously. A joke. They have a half of a sheet of paper, one side, as their wine list. No flights, no tastings. But for the audience it attracts who are easily impressed by over-priced glop and wine in a trendy area, they'll continue to do just fine. I will never be back.\n",

            "Original: I try to like you Postinos, I really do but you make it so hard.  Came on a Tuesday for their 8 PM $20 Bottle of wine and bruschetta special and left disappointed and annoyed.The parking lot disaster strikes again!  LGO now put up signs saying 25 min parking for LGO customers only and has a lot monkey stationed to chase away people trying to park in those spaces.  I was told by the lot monkey that I could valet ($3 charge) or I could park 3 blocks away if I didn't want to pay the fee.  Keep in mind this is a Tuesday and I have to pay to park my car because the restaurant blocks off all the spaces.Once seated my friend and I tried to catch up for a moment when the server came over to take our drink orders.  Since we had just sat down we asked for some time to take a look at the menu.  Our server came back a few minutes later and asked if we were ready to order.  No suggestions on a wine, no questions if we had questions, just \"you ready to order\"We ordered a bottle and bruschetta and our waiter disappeared.  For the rest of the night.  I watched him refill wine glasses at other tables, ours was brought by another server.  Other tables had their plates cleared when they were finished, ours sat in front of us until another server took them away.  Our server obviously didn't want our business because about an hour after we sat down he came back to the table and asked if we were interested in any dessert.  We said no and he immediately dropped the check on the table and left.  No offer of another round of drinks, just here is your check.The wine we had was amazing and was a steal at the price plus the bruschetta.  The bruschetta themselves were half assed.  3 of the 4 weren't even sliced all the way through but over all they were decent.Yet again Postinos shows they want my money but not my patronage.

            "Translated: I try to like you Postinos, I really do but you make it so hard.  Came on a Tuesday for their 8 PM $20 Bottle of wine and bruschetta special and left disappointed and annoyed.The parking lot disaster strikes again!  LGO now put up signs saying 25 min parking for LGO customers only and has a lot monkey stationed to chase away people trying to park in those spaces.  I was told by the lot monkey that I could valet ($3 charge) or I could park 3 blocks away if I didn't want to pay the fee.  Keep in mind this is a Tuesday and I have to pay to park my car because the restaurant blocks off all the spaces.Once seated my friend and I tried to catch up for a moment when the server came over to take our drink orders.  Since we had just sat down we asked for some time to take a look at the menu.  Our server came back a few minutes later and asked if we were ready to order.  No suggestions on a wine, no questions if we had questions, just \"you ready to order\"We ordered a bottle and bruschetta and our waiter disappeared.  For the rest of the night.  I watched him refill wine glasses at other tables, ours was brought by another server.  Other tables had their plates cleared when they were finished, ours sat in front of us until another server took them away.  Our server obviously didn't want our business because about an hour after we sat down he came back to the table and asked if we were interested in any dessert.  We said no and he immediately dropped the check on the table and left.

Postino and LGO are complete cluster F***s for anyone who plans on driving there.

I have been to all of the locations and my experience at this location has unfortunately changed. When I first stated going to this Postino I loved it! Me and my roommate would visit every Sunday religiously. We always got great service! Food was fantastic and timely. But it seems as if the the 40th street location is either under new management or just has new rude employees. I no longer go to this location because of a couple negative encounters with servers. I had no idea it was there business how many women I take on dates there. You would think the business would be appreciated. I was shocked when a server made a snide comment about my dating habits right in front of a lady friend. I would have been pretty pissed if that was an actual date. Very unprofessional staff at this location!I recommend going to the newer Central & Camelback location if you are planning on visiting Postino. Pros:- cheap tasty bruschetta- reasonable wine prices- decent beers on tap- crazy fast but borderline annoying water refills- short wait timesCons- rude servers- shallow menu- bad for taking dates\n",

Lost a star because parking is horrible despite the free but really not free valet parking. Lost a star because I do not like eating up. Meaning the table was so low you have a lot of distance to the mouth and more opportunity to spill. Lost a star because I don't like eating in my living room. Why are restaurants now making their dining room a living room If you want to do the sofa and chair thing do it outside. Not fond of high tops either. Lost a star because they opened the garage door. We chose to sit inside for a reason. They opened it and all of a sudden it was 60 degrees.\n",

After looking over what I would consider the 'Cliffs Notes' version of a wine list (BS on calling yourself a wine cellar), we chose a bottle of the ONEHOPE Red Cab.

In an attempt to move past the mediocre start to the evening we moved on to the food menu.  The TomatoBasilMozzarella bruschetta had no basil (wtf), the Orzo and Shrimp starter lacked the red onion it so desperately needed to be a success and who in their right mind serves their pizza on oversized crackers Just because you throw something 'fancy' on the menu like duck confit doesn't mean you have a license to lack on quality.

I called the bar to confirm the days of the week and time for wine tasting about two months before the event was posted. The day of the event, I called as instructed before with the total number of attendees. There were fifteen in our group that day. Soon after arrival,  I asked the waitress when the wine tasting going to start. The waitress told me the days of the wine tasting were held during the week. Of course, a wine tasting was not schedule for the day the Group visited the My Wine Cellar.The owner, an Asian woman came over and shared with me and members of the group, \"...You should have called... did you find the information about the wine tasting on my website.....\" This was the extent of the owner's response until I found the website with the information about the wine tasting on my smart phone. The owner looked at the website. I pointed out the information on this site was more recent in publication than The Wine Cellar website. She responded again with the same statements as before and walked away. The feedback from the group was consistent. Members of the group as well as myself were irritated at the owner indifference. The owner was aware of the information out there about her company language used... thus response, \"Did you find the information about the wine tasting on my website.....\". The waitress was very helpful and apologized, the owner did not. The owner put the blame on me... \"You should have called. I have been an organizer of a Meetup group and I called before...\" I did.A member of the group went to the owner to share her dismay at the indifference. One of the owners replies from the conversation included, \"So tell me... what do you want for free...\" Yup! Nice! The owner sent over a bucket of wine with no glasses. We ended up using water glasses that were left at the table from when we were first seated. We were there for two hours making the best the situation. The average bill ranged from $15 to $60. The group will not come back to The Wine bar. This review will be posted everywhere it can be posted. By the way the food was okay and the drinks prices average.\n",

            "Original: I really, really wanted to like this place. We've given it 3 shots but our experience has been consistent. The first time we stopped in for dinner on a busy evening and sat on the patio. We really enjoyed our wine and tapas meal but our server was incredibly inattentive and we had to chase her down every time we wanted anything. I brushed that off to a really busy night so we returned for a second visit. This time it wasn't that busy so we enjoyed a nice bottle of wine and food. Again, a really inattentive server. When we wanted to check out we literally had to go find her. 3rd try - stopped in for a glass of wine in the early evening. Unfortunately the 3rd visit was the worst. I asked the server if they had happy hour specials and she informed me that yes and we had just made it with 10 minutes left. When we were ready to order we couldn't find her anywhere so went to the bar hoping to make the happy hour deadline. She then came to the table and took our order. 30 seconds later she comes back telling us \"Sorry, you missed the cut-off for happy hour\".....yeah, we missed it because you never came back! Grrrr......We received our wine and waited for our food (we only ordered two really simple appetizers)...and waited....and waited. No one came by so we went up to the bar again to ask about our food. When our server came back she said sorry but our deep fryer broke today and we had to run out to Kohl's and buy a little fryer and that big table was ahead of you. Seriously It's bad enough that they are cooking with a Fry Daddy but never never tell your customers something like that.  After 40 full minutes we received our appetizers, our wine glasses empty. No, she didn't ask if we wanted another glass. She then came back to tell us that her shift was over but no worries, that other girl will take care of you. \"That other girl\" never came by....ever. We had to go up to the bar once again and ask for our check. I fully expected a discount because of the fiasco but no. Not even an apology. So I told them our experience and the manager came over. She said she was happy to take off one appetizer. Great. Except she talked a little too long about all the problems they were having in the kitchen today. So we waited for our revised bill....and waited....and waited. Are you kidding me We had to go up to the bar to get the check. It's a nice little wine bar with pretty good food but 3 strikes and you are out. We will not return here. Very unfortunate for us and them.\n",

(with the alcohol part)  I don't know what was charged to the wedding couple but it was a rip-off.  Money was given for open bar (a limited amount) and a certain amount was supposed to be held for the wedding party. (about 12)  Lots of guests arrived before the wedding party and the bartenders had pretty much burned through the bar tab limit BEFORE the wedding party arrived!  Brand drinks were cash bar and my wife and I have our preferences so I paid out of pocket for ALL of our drinks (should have helped with the rest of the guests...BUT)  Anyway, the bar closed off the 'tab' way too early.... I think they just double-billed and ripped us off.  At my arrival, I ordered 2 drinks and was charged $18.50 (plus tip)..... 45 minutes later I ordered two more OF THE SAME DRINKS.... CHARGE: $19!!  45 minutes after after that... I ordered the same 2 drinks AGAIN.... charge: $21.50 (before tip) Now.... howwhy did the price increase from $18.50 to $21.50 in the course of an hour and a half Unless it was a rip off  (several complaints heard about weak or NO ALCOHOL mixed drinks at $9 apiece) The dance floor was ok.  The conversation nooks were good, but I don't like to be taken advantage of.  Complaining at a wedding reception makes you look like a jerk.  Soooo, I'm telling you now.... I will never go there based on this first and last exposure to this  place.  You'd think they'd try to impress folks at a special occasion like this so those of us might go back on our own.  Instead.... why would I go EXPECTING to get screwed\n",

I ordered the same 2 drinks AGAIN.... charge: $21.50 (before tip) Now.... howwhy did the price increase from $18.50 to $21.50 in the course of an hour and a half Unless it was a rip off  (several complaints heard about weak or NO ALCOHOL mixed drinks at $9 apiece) The dance floor was ok.  The conversation nooks were good, but I don't like to be taken advantage of.  Complaining at a wedding reception makes you look like a jerk.  Soooo, I'm telling you now.... I will never go there based on this first and last exposure to this  place.  You'd think they'd try to impress folks at a special occasion like this so those of us might go back on our own.  Instead.... why would I go EXPECTING to get screwed\n",
            "Original: Thanks sunset club for putting me through hell.  My friend and I decided to stop in after Tyber was beat.  The first thing that sucked was the cover was expensive for such a small club ($20).  The DJ was probably the only good thing in here. We decided to get some drinks and had fun dancing and mingling with some ladies, but at the end of the night is where hell hit. I went to close out my tab and my tab was $97 for 3 beers.  I told the bartender she must have made a mistake. She goes, oh its not a mistake.  Some black guy was using your card and purchased 5 bottles of champagne and this tab.  The card got declined ( thank god somehow) after he tried to swipe it for the 5th time in an hour and he left. Basically the bartender gave my debit card to another guy! The manager came out and and the bartender explained then that she handed my card to another guy and he was using it all night.  I told her to cancel out all the charges because the liability falls on you.  She said no.  I ended up calling the cops and when she spoke to the cops her story changed. She said that the bartender never gave my card to him and that he must have been using my name.  The cops then told me to dispute with the card company because it wasnt getting anywhere.  3 months later my case is finally closed and I have my $500 back.  Eff this place.\n",

This place is in the middle of BFE, with nowhere else to eat except the desert, and I don't care for cactus or rocks...so I sucked it upand did the only thing I could do under the circumstances.I sat there eating my lunch....fixating on how I'd just blasted through one fifth of my unemployment check on a fucking turkey sandwich. Not going back.\n",
            "Original: Hello,And I hope this review does exactly what I intend for it to do. Get the principals of this joke for a restaurant,  who ever they are,  to read it and wake up. Obviously they must be eating the dog food they have been fed by others who rave about this place.Let's start at the beginning, went for lunch, walked in, saw people at tables so waited to see if an employee would be directing us. NOPE!! nothing of the sorts, walked up to an outdoor menu over a entrance, again what do I do next People inside look at you but don't ask to help you. We had our dog with us, so I asked my girlfriend to go in and see what she can find out. She walked to the counter and again no one would help. Can I order Then a person replied and pointed \"you start down there\" Okay great, were getting somewhere. She placed an order for a salad (pre-made crushed into a small container) a chicken salad sandwich and a lemonade. she came out and handed me the salad and drinks and said ' let's find a table, I have to go over to another area to wait for the sandwich\"  I sat down at a table with our dog outdoors next to  32nd street (This is a farm) and she went to get the sandwich.  OH the daymare has just started. After about 20 minutes, she sent me a text and said,\" I haven't left you, still waiting\" This is Chicken Salad People!!! slap it on the bread add some lettuce and tomatoes and it's ready to go. Here's where it gets really good, several people who arrived after us are getting their food from the mystery window by the red umbrella. My girlfriend has now been standing there 30 minutes waiting, she taps on the window and asks \" is there a problem with the chicken salad.\"  \"I'll check\"  the window closes and 10 minutes later the window opens revealing the sandwich.  Now I would say this is possibly a one off scenario except right before she received our sandwich another person who had been waiting said he was on 37 minutes, and then another person came up while she was receiving her sandwich and said \"how long does it take to get a tuna sandwich\" he had been waiting 30 minutes.We eat what I would say is ordinary fresh food, nothing to write home about, and because I found the concept of standing and waiting 40 minutes to get an average sandwich so ridiculous, I stopped back in to express myself and politely said  \"This is our first time here and your service was awful and we will never return\"Their response, exactly like the whole experience started. NOTHING.And although we typically know what items cost before we eat anywhere, so initially the price seemed okay but this place is definitely OVERPRICED.\n",

            "Original: Run, don't walk, away from Carmel Family Physicians!I've been a patient of CFP for about 3 years.  I've never really been happy, but as I've been looking to leave the area, I hadn't pursued another doctor until now.  By far the biggest problem they have is their phonesupport staff.I certainly don't expect CFP to diagnose me over the phone, but if I contact them for a follow up on an appointment I had, it's like pulling teeth to get a call back.  Calls typically take multiple business days to be returned - if they are at all.  This includes the time that I was in pain to the point I was spending 12 the day in bed.  Or the time I was traveling and forgot my prescription, and asked for a small quantity to be prescribed as I was 2000 miles away from the only bottle I had.  I've even called and spoken with management about not getting timely callbacks, but nothing has changed after months!Their patient referral service isn't any better.  I've been called and \"told\" by their staff when my referred appointment was - without any input from me on what fits my schedule.  I've tried asking them for the name of the doctor so I can make my own appointment, only to be told they don't have that and only the referral person does.  Or the time I was in pain making it impossible to leave bed, and the only doctor they could refer me to didn't have any appointments for 1.5 months - and they had no other suggestions on where to go.  The final straw was when I inquired about a preventive medicine for me.  The response I was given amounted to \"I've heard of that, but I don't know enough about it to be comfortable prescribing it.\"  There was no willingness for the doctor to research and follow up to me.  He couldn't even recommend a specialist who was familiar with it - and this wasn't an experimental treatment - this was a relatively new, but manufacturer-recognized use of a 10+ year old medicine.I don't think I've ever felt that CFP was customer-focused.  Rather, when I go there, I feel like I am viewed as a \"necessary evil\" for them to collect their money.  Don't go here - you will regret it.\n",

It had only been an hour wait getting in to examination room.The receptionist are the biggest bunch of rude obnoxious.......they have just about done everything but give me the finger. I can't tell you how many times my insurance company didn't ante up so they will call you up to the front of the waiting area and in front of EVERYONE ask about it and ask quite rudely. Then tell me they \"tried\" to call  so I deserve being called up to the front of the class. So embarrassing, especially when your sick. They even called me up when my husband (who had a different insurance plan) had not paid. AND told me I couldn't see the DR because of it! Thats after I had waited fifteen minutes already. I have no idea what I was supposed to do. Go beat up his insurance companyThen there was the time I was prescribed medication that sent me to the ER. Wait no hold on there was the TWO times that medication was prescribed to me that sent me to the ER.And the time they told my son he had loose joints when in fact he had scoliosis. Where you get loose joints from curvature of the spine is anyone's guess. And then when Dr. Bauer accused me of being a smoker, when I told her I wasn't. She told me I was lying....because you know thats what I do. Lie to GP's....Its a bit of a sinful delight for me. I always hope it gets me improved care......oh wait. The long waits where always enjoyable. If I got out of there in less than a hour it would have seemed nothing short of a miracle. You better plan on a lonnnnnng wait. They are making vacation plans after all. I could go on for days. This place is awful. **AWFUL***  Please, go somewhere, anywhere else.  The homeless guy on the corner would probably give you better care. He'd be cheaper thats for sure!\n",

After waiting for another 10 minutes, I was called up to the desk and told that I was MORE than 15 minutes late and had to reschedule my appointment. My appointment was at 4:00, so apparently they cannot tell time.  I explained that I called ahead, got lost and that I was a student who also worked part time so it was very hard for me to reschedule and  the doctor actually refused to see me. The staff was incredibly rude and should have told me not to come in the first place. I left the office in tears out of frustration and embarrassment from the way I was treated. It is clear that Dr. O'Clair has no respect for her patients...as if we have never waited 15 minutes for a doctor before.\n",

My insurance covers preventative care 100% and I have a large deductible for sick visits.  I went, had no health complaints, and the nurse told me I was the healthiest person she had seen all day.The practice then billed a sick visit code to my insurance, which applied $130 to my deductible.  I called the billing number, explained the situation, and asked that they bill the prevantative visit code to my insurance.  The billing person told me the doctors pick the code, not the billing people, but he would check with the doctor and call me back the next day.He never called.  I left two voicemails for the billing guy, which he never returned.I appealed to my insurance, who denied because the doctor used a sick visit code.Sooo, my doctor is still sending me bills for the prevantative visit that is covered 100% by my insurance.

            "Original: I was referred to this practice by a colleague of mine. I was very excited to find a \"one stop shop\" family practice where lab and x-ray's can be done in the office, to avoid the troubles of having to go to a lab and wait for the results, then go back into the office. Dr. Sobel is a very personal man. I have no qualms with him. However, my first visit, Jessica, was quite rude and remained so with every visit.  Although I had a scheduled appointment, I waited in the lobby for about 30 plus mins before being walked back, only to wait another 15-20 mins before Dr. Larry would see me. At first I thought it was just an anomaly. However, it was like that every visit, and the office staff was not forthcoming about running behind schedule, and very unapologetic. Yesterday's experience took me over the edge. My appt was at 3:40p.m., I did not get called back into the office until after 4:45p.m. LITERALLY! I had checked in with \"Jessica\" a couple of times to inquire as to why it was taking so long, she said my \"chart was up there and will be called in order\", stating, \"this is Dr. Larry\".  However, I noted some people were called in earlier than I that came in later. I was finally seated in an exam room and waited until 5:14 p.m. before coming out and asking what the deal was. I asked if Dr. Sobel was being over booked or this is how late he runs all the time. They said, \"It's Dr. Sobel\". \"He spends a lot of time with his patient's\". Although that may be a good thing, it should not be at the expense of the next patient.  it is my professional opinion, that if he spends a lot of time with his patient's, then they should schedule accordingly to allow room for that time, instead of making patient's wait an hour and a half to be seen. This kind of management is totally unprofessional and unacceptable. Of note, Dr. Larry Sobel overheard my questioning, and while visiting with another patient, and said...\"You can leave if you want\". I left and will not be back again.The courtesy from his staff up front should've been, Dr. Larry is running an hour behind...and allow me the option to reschedule.\n",

Dr. Mora is our family doctor. Dr. Mora is incredibly knowledgeable, and getting an appointment to see him is very easy. When you meet Dr. Mora, he always greets you with a hand-shake and takes the time to sit down and actually talk to you about your healthcare needs. It is important to note that Dr. Mora has moved his practice location recently. Dr. Mora used to be with John C. Lincoln Health Network - Saguaro Family Practice group located at 18404 North Tatum Boulevard , Phoenix, AZ 85032, (602) 992-1900. This John C. Lincoln group was atrocious!

Not to mention the office was always filthy which did not make me feel very comfortable going there. (Also you should know that if you call the John C. Lincoln office where Dr. Mora used to work, they will NOT tell you that Dr. Mora has moved. Instead they will try and make you see one of their other doctors there, and I would not recommend any other doctor there to see.) So, I couldn't be happier that Dr. Mora has moved! Dr. Mora now works for Scottsdale Healthcare Primary Care Paradise Valley, 5010 E. Shea Blvd., Suite D100, Scottsdale, AZ 85254, (480) 882-7420. This new location is the kind of doctor office you feel comfortable going to. It is very clean and the staff are very courteous and extremely helpful.

            "Original: I have been a patient here for my over 6 years, however the many of the old doctors have retired, and their spots have been filled with qualified but uncaring doctors.I made an appointment with the hospital several weeks prior to look at my arm which I believed to be fractured or splintered at the bone.  Two days before my appointment a itchy bacterial rash spread across my back.  On appointment day I was told that I would have to choose between getting a prescription for the infection spreading across my back or them looking at my arm.  Of course the rash took precedence at the time, so 5 minutes and one small little piece of paper after my appointment started I was shuffled out the door--arm still in extreme pain, unacknowledged and ignored by the doctor.Word of advice: If scheduling an appointment here, do NOT schedule with Dr. Luis M Irizarry.  He doesn't care about anything but herding cattle in and out the door so he can make as much money as possible in a given day.\n",

We arrived inside to find a large party. There was no direction for someone who has never been there. On top of that, the party had stragglers filter in, so of course they nonchalantly cut in line because they were there for the party. It should not work that way.

After standing in line for an hour, the couple in front of us approached the counter to find out there was a 2 hour wait for a race. We didn't even wait to get to the counter before we said enough of this. There was no management around and found the laziness of the employees. We were disappointed in this place, but it's not really like one complaints going to hurt this. I just hope they learn how to be more effective at their operations and their customer service.

I EVEN OFFERED to use a credit card to hold the seat. I was told that \"it wouldn't be a problem to reserve the class seat\". I then asked for a recommendation for local lodging. I was told \"WE ARE RUNNING A SPECIAL LODGING DEAL\". Those that attended this class were to have the Hotel rooms comp'd. Great I thought.....Until the following week. I called and got the same person on the phone to ask a different question regarding the class when I was told \"Oh there is a problem\". I asked about what This person explained 2 separate issues, first another sales person had sold the last seat for the class that I had already made all the travel arrangements for.

I was told that the person would \"try and figure out a way to fix it.\" I canceled all travel and was contacted it a few days by the sales person. I was told that I was going to be able to attend the scheduled date AND upgraded to a Corvette! The main reason for pulling the trigger on the class was because I has recently bought a 2011 Camaro SS and wanted to drive that car. I made that clear from the first contact regarding scheduling a class seat. There is more but frankly I don't feel like going back over all of it..... After not being able to offer ANYTHING to compensate me for ALL OF THEIR ERRORS, I decided to confront the General Sales Manager with a copy of all electronic correspondence regarding ALL of the issues from the beginning. In the middle of the main entrance of the facility AND IN FRONT OF AN EMPLOYEE I was told \"I'm not getting into a battle of emails.\" Then slammed the door as they left, leaving me to answer to the employee When stated \" What Just Happened\" I explained that the sales manager was busy....

I TOLD this person I would be expecting a phone call from Mr. Bondurant ASAP due to the flight I had reserved for home I could not wait.\"WAIT FOR IT....\" The next day I receive a phone call from the legend Bob Bondurant, the first words from his mouth were \"I'M PRETTY PISSED OFF RIGHT NOW,\" I WAS    FLOORED TO SAY THE LEAST......

It was very cold and windy so I didn't see my kids wristbands until their hour and a half was up and we went inside. When I went to take the wristband off my 3 year old daughter I discovered that the girl had put it on so tight that it literally cut and bruised her wrist. It took 3 of us to get it off. Needless to say, I was pretty upset. I took my daughter up front where about 10 employees were standing in a circle chatting. I showed them her wrist and one girl asked who did it. I didn't remember so I told them whose party we were attending. The girl, I believe her name was Missy, said it was her and in a very unconcerned tone said \" sorry about that.\" My friend went up several minutes later and spoke to them again, including the manager. She said she got the same reaction-not a lot of concern or sympathy. I called and spoke with both owners, Ken and Jerry. Both apologized but didn't seem too concerned. I realize they couldn't change what happened. However, knowing a 3 year old was left with cuts and bruises from a wristband because of one of their employees, I expected a little more concern and empathy. If I had done this to a child, I would feel so awful and do whatever I could to make the child and her parents feel better and know I was remorseful. I really felt like the employee and the owners were annoyed that I was bringing it to their attention. I don't feel they had any remorse whatsoever.\n",

            "Original: It's a pretty fun place when not completely  packed. But, i came here today to celebrate my brothers birthday, and the place was practically empty aside from our small group. And they didn't bother to turn on the music , nor did they even open the rides, blaming the weather , no rain. Aside from the girls who brought us our drinks and pizza, the rest of the staff was brand spanking new and far from friendly or talkative. They have a scan Qr that seems you get free tokens upon downloading their App. So I did just that, and apparently they have to give you another code to scan to unlock that, which they couldn't find! I saw they had another code there too for a free slice of pizza and a drink , so I scanned the one code they did have, and when I asked the New girl if I could redeem this one while I was at it, her manager which she called over again , who was very rude and accusing me of trying to use a code twice. Luckily the other girl there who let me scan and unlock the pizza code said I had just done it. He reluctantly gave the green for it. This place is poorly managed and gives off a very dead vibe. You'd think they'd be nicer to their only paying costumes. I won't be coming back again.\n",

            "Original: ****DO NOT GOTO THIS PLACE!!!****I came here to celebrate a bachelor party with a group of 9 guys and we signed up for the mini grand prix (3 races).  In the first race, 2 karts broke down, 1 kart went only half speed, and my own kart had a sticky gas pedal with a broken steering wheel brace.  Most of the karts didn't have functioning seat belts either.So after the first race they tell our group that they only have 5 functioning karts left and that we'd have to split our group up, even though I made a reservation in advance and they guaranteed us we'd all be able to race together.  You'd think they'd have some backup karts  Anyways, we demanded a refund right there and then but the managers AND owners absolutely refused to talk to me, even over the phone!  They told their own staff that the invoice for the reservation stated \"NO REFUNDS\", but they never sent me an invoice.  I called the day before to remind them to send me the invoice again but they failed to do so.  For the next 2 hours our group argued with the administrative staff who claimed they could do nothing to help us without manager consent.  I had the admin there pull up their copy of the invoice that was never emailed to me, and even their copy said nothing about \"NO REFUNDS\".The staff there kept calling their managers, and eventually even the managers stopped picking up their phone calls!  How shady is thatBottom line: STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!\n",

The kart was so slow I was able to drive around the entire track full throttle and one handed while maintaining my line.  people were lapping me and it was pretty disappointing.  What made it more disappointing was that they said there was nothing they could do because only 4 or 5 karts were operational so some of us were stuck using karts with known problems.  They wouldn't even give me a refund after this ordeal.  I DO NOT recommend this place.  highly unprofessional and unsatisfied.\n",

So, beware of the receptionist with two surface piercing on her collar bone. We weren't given any direction with anything. Just kind of wondered through. We had to wait 3 hours for our first lap and they seem to have forgotten our party. One of the employee was smoking while working and walked out to help move a go kart that was stuck with his cigarette in hand. my dad and my boyfriend didn't have a seat belt, well there was straps but no where to click them into. No safety enforced, no instruction, and no customer service. Overall, it was horrible. We paid for three races and a year membership. We only did two and the only reason we did the second was we went up and asked why its taking them another 2 hours to get our second race in. And when we inquired about the year membership, no one knew what that was. And no one cared really.\n",

There were 4 people ejected from my race for accidentally running into barriers. These cars are extremely powerful and fast, and for someone who has never driven one before, it is easy to get out of control. Being a beginner myself, I was the first person to crash, and was threatened to be ejected, and spoken to like I was a dumb child who had never driven a car before. This was demoralizing, not to mention, embarrassing, being that these boys yelling at me we're younger than myself.After my crash, I could hear the boys running the track area saying that their groups of racers were 'stupid' today. Listen boys, if you don't like your job, get a new one. I felt it would have helped to do a slow practice run around the track before each race, being that there are several accident prone areas that come up quickly to someone like me who has never raced the track before.My disappointment in Pole Position has caused me to recommend  NOT going there, and I, myself, my boyfriend, and our friend who went with us will not return either.\n",

This was demoralizing, not to mention, embarrassing, being that these boys yelling at me we're younger than myself.After my crash, I could hear the boys running the track area saying that their groups of racers were 'stupid' today. Listen boys, if you don't like your job, get a new one. I felt it would have helped to do a slow practice run around the track before each race, being that there are several accident prone areas that come up quickly to someone like me who has never raced the track before.My disappointment in Pole Position has caused me to recommend  NOT going there, and I, myself, my boyfriend, and our friend who went with us will not return either.\n",
            "Original: I was visiting Vegas with some friends when I checked this place out. I've been to quite a few go karting places and this was one of the worst. The track is too small for 12-13 karts at the same time. Also, the race managers are not consistent about who they stop for crashing into other karts or the walls...it seems that \"regulars\" get the preference. Give this place a miss.\n",

Sadly we only met in-person (my fiance had several phone conversations the months leading up to out wedding) with the priest the week before our wedding and it was perfectly obvious that he disliked me and my lack of Hindi.  I attempted to ask question to better understand the ceremony but that just got me scowls and grumbles.  The day of our wedding the priest was not ready and was acting as if he had forgotten about the ceremony andor the deposit we made.  Finally, after the ceremony when it was time to sign the marriage certificate he asked (actually demanded) an additional $300 to sign the certificate.  Of course we agreed- what were we to do  I am pretty sure that would be called extortion and why hadn't he simply told us before the ceremony  I am guessing because he is a thief!\n",

He did this while using the tool that looks like sharp pliers to remove dead cuticle skin. I don't get my nails done a lot, so I didn't know he wasn't doing tips anymore like I asked. He tried to give me a full manicure with a gel coating over the whole nail, no tips, without even asking me. He got far enough that I had to just have him take off the mess he made so I could just leave since I had work later. He tried to get me to stay and he tried to tell me that after he filed off the gel coat he had applied and then properly got the tips on, it takes 40 minutes to an hour AFTER THAT to put a gel coat on. I understand if the whole procedure; filing, putting on tips, putting on gel coats... that can take 40 minutes to an hour. Just a top gel coat NOT that long of a procedure. He took off the mess he made and I left. I had work to get to, and its rare I get a day off where I have time to do this. He wasted my time, he didn't ever communicate with me, and he took stupid liberties that cost us both. I would not EVER go back.\n",

            "Original: This place was AWFUL. I was using the groupon so I had to call to make a reservation for my friend and I. As soon as I told the receptionist that I would be using the groupon, she tried to hang up on me. I told her she hadn't asked for my name yet, and she hurriedly asked what it was and hung up. Fast forward 2 weeks later and big surprise, she had not written my name or my friend's name down for our reservation. Luckily, it wasn't too busy and she had my friend and I sit in her chairs. Worst mistake ever. She started off very friendly; however, I noticed after 2 coats of white gel nail polish that the color on my nails did not resemble the color that i had picked that was on the sample nail set. As soon as I told her this, she told me that the sample nails were already white and that's why the nail polish did not look the same on my nails. False advertising much She then tried to talk me out of having white nails because it would \"look bad\". After trying to convince her that I indeed wanted white nails, she hurriedly slapped on a few coats of white nail polish and went on to do my friend's nails. Worst quality ever. There were bubbles in my polish and a piece of random hair got stuck in the polish. She seemed very annoyed that I asked her to take the random hair out and fix my nail. When she asked my friend what color she wanted for her nails, my friend chose a white gel polish with sparkles, but asked the lady if the color was going to look the same as the sample (not wanting to go through the same hassle I went through). The lady responded by telling her that it was my fault that I wasn't satisfied with the color on my nails originally and that I was wrong. She then proceeded to wrap my friend's nails in foil and use the electric nail filer to take my friend's old nail polish off. She said she would have to CHARGE HER $3 FOR REMOVING HER NAIL POLISH. Her nail polish wasn't even gel or shellac, it was REGULAR NAIL POLISH for goodness sakes! As she was doing her nails, this lady kept muttering, \"Oh my God\" underneath her breath and did the WORST JOB EVER on both of our nails. We would have just gotten up and walked out except we had already purchased our groupon. This was the worst nail experience I've ever had. DO NOT GO TO MAGEN NAIL.\n",

            "Original: Ok, I'm writing this review after going to this place about 4 times. It is conveniently located near my house so having just moved here I thought id give it a shot since my regular nail place was in Tempe Marketplace and I felt lazy to go there that day. First time, I got a pedi and full set and had no issues. I did notice the quality was lower than the job they had done at my other place but I was ok with it. That particular day they were busy and I think her son and bf were both helping out. It's a family business which I think is great. Second time was a fill and pedi. She seemed to be n a rush and my nails were all sloppy and the clear coat wasn't covering the whole nail, some nails weren't even and  just a sloppy job. She asked me who had done my nails... I told her she had (the owner).Third time, I went in... Same thing... The girl doing my pedi n French tip couldn't get it right.... They were all uneven and almost looked like they used whiteout for the tips. Messy. When the owner started doing my nails she noticed I kept looking at my toes and she offered to take a look after my nails were done. Well. Again, she saw the sloppy work from the previous time and AGAIN asked me who had done my nails... I told her it was her.  She finished and again.... Same thing... Nails not even... Clear coat not covering entire nail and bumps all over. I hate complaining so I just asked she looked at my toes which she did and had the girl redo them... I felt bad. I came back a couple days later cause I broke a nail and I mentioned to her about the clear coat and I showed her... And she fixed it. She also fixed my broke nail and it looked weird cause she did it (again) like always in a hurry and it was not as wide as the other nails. Whatever I left. I went back yesterday (111813) and she meets me at door saying \"oh we too busy\" it's only three of them working.... And I was like \"ok\" (sounded like she was telling me to go!!) I said it's ok I can wait....  Well I should've left!!!! I decided to get my toenails red... That's how bad I didn't want the girl to try doing the French tip! I never paint my toe nails red!! Ever!!! Then (the owner) started looking at my nails and she AGAIN asked me who had done them cause they didn't look good and asked why that broken nail SHE had fixed wasn't as wide as the others!!!!!!! I told her it was herself and she shut up. She honestly seems to be very very lazy and ALWAYS ALWAYS in a hurry. I'm not the type of person that complains but I don't like telling u how to do your job either cause I don't like others telling me how to do mine. But this time... I had had it. I asked her to fix several things... And then she puts the clear coat... And tells me to put my hands n the dryer thingy... Once my nails were done.. I pull them out and she files the edges a bit... And she damages one of the nails n the side taking off the clear coat... I tell her and she said \"oh u did it when u out ur hand down\" SHE WAS STILL HOLDING MY HAND!!!  And then I asked her about three other nails not fully covered with clear coat.  She reapplied and after 2 mins n the dryer thing she said I was done. I looked at my nails and she could see I was upset.  Because she just reapplied clear on too of the other clear that wasn't even dry.. There's bumps and u can see the ridges of the little brush....  I was supposed to get my eyebrows done but i was scared she would just wax it all off... So I told her never mind. As I'm paying she sees I'm not happy cause I keep looking at my nails and she says... \"U ok I fix for u\" I said \"don't worry about it\"... I paid.. Left no tip and walked out. I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt but not anymore.Her work is very VERY VERY SLOPPY.... She is ALWAYS is a hurry and ALWAYS understaffed. I would never recommend this place to anyone cause they will be very unhappy with her work. I wished she had more pride n what she does. Being n the customer service field I know that when I'm with a customer... That's my only customer and I concentrate n them and only them. To rush and have a bad product or service is just not good business. If u go there, be ready to wait at least 30 minutes before being seen.\n",

Which she had no clients and was just sitting there. I explained my previous bad experience at another salon and she said Victoria would take good care of me. Victoria was nice and My nails looked decent when I left. not 24hrs passed and three nails chipped. Then I went back Wednesday night and showed Jennifer the nails she said she would fix then passed me to another lady who proceeded to drill my nail to remove all the gel. I told her to stop and explained it was soak off gel. The lady did not understand. Jennifer identified the commotion then came over. I explained the drill and she told the girl. I was so frustrated at this point and Jennifer finally agreed to correct and work on me. I told her to forget it and I would do it myself. All my nails broke and chipped. I was so disappointed with the experience I had. I am a loyal customer and just wanted quality service. I will never patronize this store ever and would advise anyone seeking quality to look else where.\n",

            "Original: Meh. I went here for an appointment with Anastasia for gel and glitter. I waited patiently and ended up with an appointment with a completely different person than what I was told I was going to see. I asked her I wanted gel with glitter and she had no idea what I was talking about. She said she can do gel polish with glitter in it but not any type of loose glitter with gel. The lady they gave me only does regular acrylic nails and was even too afraid to do the glitter as she didn't know what she was doing. Finally another lady said that she can do it but that i would need to wait a moment until she's finished with the appointment. I waited a half an hour and finally saw the lady. I did not realize that she was pushing me in between her appointment and she did it very quickly, maybe lasted about 20 minutes. I have never had my nails done that only takes 20 minutes. She ended up using a shellac gel instead of an actual gel builder. And it was very clumpy and uneven, to were you could see a dip in the middle of each of my nails. The only reason I'm giving it any stars is that the owner was very apologetic and tried to accommodate the situation, but I was disappointed. Also, I had went there with a spa finder gift card. I had $10 left. instead of just taking the money off of that card and giving me the card to go somewhere else, the receptionist traded it for a total bliss card. This now, forces me to have to go back to them just use the rest of the card.\n",

The girl waxing my brows talked at me the entire time, so much so that I wondered whether or not she could possibly be focusing on what she was doing. After 15 minutes, spewing out of a partial life story and some pretty horrific gum smacking inches from my face (all on HER parth, ha), my brows were \"done.\" They were decently shaped (nothing special) but the clean up was atrocious. I had errant hairs that I had to request my esthetician pluck and she did (while I stood up). However, when I got home, I still had to clean up myself. Bad, bad, bad and it cost twice as much as any perfectly decent salon wax. I wish I'd had something even NEAR the experience other yelpers have had.\n",

She gathered a few things, continued to apologize & assured me she'd be right back.  Ten mins later, the front desk girl came in to offer me water & apologize for Shar's absence; she also assured me Shar would be back within two minutes. Fifteen minutes after that, with no sign of Shar returning, I gathered my things & left.

            "Original: I was very curious about eyelash extensions so I purchased a groupon for a \"flirt set\" at The Brow Lady. The shop is small and it looks like they do a range of services like nails and waxing as well. I agree with Shar B. about the front desk staff. I wasn't greeted in a friendly manner upon entering either, just hustled into the back room.First of all, I really wish their website gave some details and information on the do's and dont's of having these lashes if you've never gotten them before. If you live in a humid climate (or plan on traveling to a humid climate), or do anything like swimming or hot yoga, then skip them. Here I was lying on the table telling my eyelash lady that I was about to leave for a trip to southeast Asia (I was hoping to do the eyelashes and forgo packing makeup) and she tells me \"well I'll be surprised if they last a week\". Huh So I said \"what do I do if I go swimming\" and she says \"dry them immediately with a hairdryer\". Of note, there are no electrical outlets in the remote jungle of Laos, and no, I wasn't  planning on bringing a hairdryer. As she was applying I was already feeling cheated in paying for this once I heard they wouldn't last, but then she commented that she finished in record time....30 min. I thought ok, how long does it normally take Their brochure and website says 1 12 hrs. So now, I was feeling cheated again, like I didn't get the full treatment because I came in with a groupon. Well she was right about them falling off. As I sweated my way through yoga and then enjoyed swimming, etc on my trip they became scarce. I eventually had to pull the remaining few off which wasn't fun. They might be worth it for a really important occasion like your wedding or something, but don't plan on them lasting through your honeymoon.\n",

            "Original: Let me start off by saying I've been here once before for eyebrows and they didn't turn out so well. I ended up with scabs on both my eyebrows for two weeks (not too pretty). Now let me start my review on my nails... They made it a bit difficult for me to make an appointment, but since I was leaving town they could squeeze me in. I got there, was seated pretty quickly, and then chose my color. I decided to go with gels, I've done them before so I knew the process fairly well. There was absolutely no room in their \"nail salon\" section. I didn't feel as if my girl did my nails well what-so-ever. I feel bad to name her, because in all honestly she was extremely sweet just had no idea how to do proper gels or a standard pedicure. My gels were soft, and had indents in them. Gels are supposed to be hard so that kind of thing doesn't happen. Now my pedicure... It was awful! She didn't know how to do an even coat. I do not understand. I do a much better job. So I called the manager, Nikki I believe was her name. All she did was make excuses for the girl saying oh maybe it was bad lighting or a bad curing machine for the gels. Seriously I would never go back there to see any nail tech. They offered to do my nails again but honestly it was so uncomfortable in there and everyone had to keep moving around each other. Save your money and find an actual nail salon where they have some massage chairs and space!\n",

When I showed up on time for my appointment, the two girls at the front let me know that they were \"just about to email me\" because they were running behind. I get it. This is the nature Of the service industry. I completely understand if a business gets busy and begins to fall behind. However, I am sure that they realized at some point (at minimum half an hour or so) before my appointment, that they were running behind. To reach out to me at the exact time of my appointment is pretty rude, since by that time, customers (like me) are generally already at the business's location ready for their appointment. I was also frustrated, because the receptionist also said that she was just about to \"email me.\" This made no sense to me, as they already had my cell phone number, which is a much more reliable way to contact someone (especially when you're calling them at the exact time of their appointment, when they are usually parking or walking in; not checking email). I was extra disappointed because I was doing my nails for my anniversary and had a hair appointment and spray tan scheduled right after (meaning no flexibility in the schedule). The girls were very sweet and apologetic, but the lack of professionalism around simply picking up the phone and calling me as soon as they realized that they were falling behind is pretty inexcusable.\n",

            "Original: A NOTE TO THE OWNER:Your employee, the scrawny, balding man, should be fired. He was yelling at me and saying extremely rude things instead of fixing the nails to make the customer happy. I've never been treated this way by any company that I've ever done business with. I urge you to take a few moments to read about what happened from the customer's point of view, as I'm sure that you may hear about it but from a different light that is favorable to the scrawny, balding man.MY REVIEW: They shouldn't even get ONE STAR. The scrawny man with the receding hair that works there is the ultimate cause of this poor review.Sit back and enjoy this story...This was my very first time at this place and I was actually excited because the interior was pretty nice.I went in to touch up my gel polish and get a pedicure. I get French on both, and I've gotten it done enough times to know that the white part should not have BUBBLES or CRATERS in it! So I kindly asked him to fix the white part before we put it under the UV light again. So he did, and we put it under the light, when I took them out...there they were...craters, bubbles, missing white parts, streaks...(how do you post pics on here) I swear it looked like I did it myself. He said it's supposed to look like that.Instead of fixing them, he yelled at me...I mean...he YELLED AT ME worse than my own father ever has. He was so rude, and the things he said to me were jaw dropping! I honestly was in shock and could not believe my ears! Now, I know that people say that there are two sides to every story, but I promise you that I wasn't happy with the white part and asked him to fix it and he flipped out and started taking it off! As a customer...I've never ever been talked to, oh I'm sorry, YELLED AT, like that in my entire life. I told him, \"I've never been treated this way in my life. You're being very rude to a first time customer!\" He said, \"Ive never had a customer tell me how to do my job!\"I said, I'm just asking you to fix the white, LOOK can't you see the dots Does this honestly look okay to you\" Then he started to file it all offf.I was like \"what are you doing, just fix the white!\" He said, \"No I'm gonna take it off and you can just leave\"I said, \"What No, I came here to get my nails done and I just don't want the french white part to have bubbles or dots on it.\"He yelled, \"I've been doing this 20 years, how old are you (I don't know what my age has to do with it, but I suppose he was trying to say that he's been doing this longer than I've been living.\" (for the record I'm 28 and not an immature teenager bashing this place) Anyway, so the yelling at me continued and at this point I begin to yell back because I was not going to take the verbal abuse or mistreatment any longer. I've never experienced such an episode.He had the UV thing on my lap, I tried to hand it to him and I said please get this off of me, and he slid his seat away and was telling me to drop it so it can break!

            "Translated: A NOTE TO THE OWNER:Your employee, the scrawny, balding man, should be fired. He was yelling at me and saying extremely rude things instead of fixing the nails to make the customer happy. I've never been treated this way by any company that I've ever done business with. I urge you to take a few moments to read about what happened from the customer's point of view, as I'm sure that you may hear about it but from a different light that is favorable to the scrawny, balding man.MY REVIEW: They shouldn't even get ONE STAR. The scrawny man with the receding hair that works there is the ultimate cause of this poor review.Sit back and enjoy this story...This was my very first time at this place and I was actually excited because the interior was pretty nice.I went in to touch up my gel polish and get a pedicure. I get French on both, and I've gotten it done enough times to know that the white part should not have BUBBLES or CRATERS in it! So I kindly asked him to fix the white part before we put it under the UV light again. So he did, and we put it under the light, when I took them out...there they were...craters, bubbles, missing white parts, streaks...(how do you post pics on here) I swear it looked like I did it myself. He said it's supposed to look like that.Instead of fixing them, he yelled at me...I mean...he YELLED AT ME worse than my own father ever has. He was so rude, and the things he said to me were jaw dropping! I honestly was in shock and could not believe my ears! Now, I know that people say that there are two sides to every story, but I promise you that I wasn't happy with the white part and asked him to fix it and he flipped out and started taking it off! As a customer...I've never ever been talked to, oh I'm sorry, YELLED AT, like that in my entire life. I told him, \"I've never been treated this way in my life. You're being very rude to a first time customer!\" He said, \"Ive never had a customer tell me how to do my job!\"I said, I'm just asking you to fix the white, LOOK can't you see the dots Does this honestly look okay to you\" Then he started to file it all offf.I was like \"what are you doing, just fix the white!\" He said, \"No I'm gonna take it off and you can just leave\"I said, \"What No, I came here to get my nails done and I just don't want the french white part to have bubbles or dots on it.\"He yelled, \"I've been doing this 20 years, how old are you (I don't know what my age has to do with it, but I suppose he was trying to say that he's been doing this longer than I've been living.\" (for the record I'm 28 and not an immature teenager bashing this place) Anyway, so the yelling at me continued and at this point I begin to yell back because I was not going to take the verbal abuse or mistreatment any longer. I've never experienced such an episode.He had the UV thing on my lap, I tried to hand it to him and I said please get this off of me, and he slid his seat away and was telling me to drop it so it can break! Seriously! drop itThen I said, \"I want to talk to the owner of this place. You are so rude and should not be treating customers this way!\"He YELLED at the top of his lungs like he wanted to hit me...\"NO! YOU ARE NOT GOING TO TALK TO THE OWNER, YOU DEAL WITH ME I'M THE BOSS NOW!!\" I was like WHAT IN THE WORLD IS YOUR PROBLEM I just wanted you to fix the white part of my nails!Then he said, \"pay for the pedicure and get out of here and we will be happy if you never come back!\" (can you believe this guy!)I don't know how this next part even happened (and this literally JUST HAPPENED) but he said he was going to call the cops, I was like good, please do, or better yet, I will.

            "Original: I have gone to this club in the past and have enjoyed the experience.   I recently decided to revisit this club and had a bad experience .  I saw a dancer that caught my eye. I offered her a drink and a dance. After her canoodling me  I gave in and said i'll take  one ( 30 dollar)  dance.After some pleasant conversation over the drink( I treated her to),  the dance began .  After four minutes the song was over and I reached in my pocket to give her the 30 + 5 dollars for a tip, when she explained I actually owed her 60 dollars  because it was 2 songs.  By my count it was one dance. Apparently she decided to count the 5 minutes of  time we spent talking over the drinks i bought her as part of the dance as well.   I thought she was kidding and gave her the $ 35. This  beautiful little angel suddenly became a crazy little devil. She called her manager and made me out to be some kind of lunatic lowlife cheapskate.   I politely explained the situation to the  manager but he insisted i pay up which i promptly did .  After wards i made a quick exit.   There was no mistaken that I was being blatantly scammed here.  I was in the club for less then 10 minutes and hadn't even finished my first beer, and was not drunk in the least.   Unless you don't mind being scammed by a dancer, and paying 60 dollars for a 4 minute dance I would  steer clear from this establishment .  A night I was hoping to relax over a beer and a beautiful dancer cost me 80 dollars for less then 10 minutes of harassment and aggravation.  It appears to be a pretty good club and i couldn't say if they regularly scam the patrons,  but  they sure as hell scammed me.  On principle I'll avoid this place  and I'll tell my friends to go elsewhere as well. The are  a ton of clubs in the area with gorgeous girls  that even have signs on the table that you will never pay for a dancer's time or for  her simply talking to you.You've  been warned .Jay\n",

            "Original: Picture it, if you will.  Little old me, drinking at the Bikini Lounge from 2 in the afternoon until midnight with 3 friends.  Drinking, drinking, drinking.  So after 10+ hours of living solely off of beer, there can surely be no better idea than going to a strip club.  RightSo we pack up and head on over.  A high cover (sorry, for the life of me I don't remember how much) and a 2 drink minimum (which I do realize is standard) later, we're immersed in black light.  As my eyes adjust, I start to see that this is really not the crowd I expected to see in a strip club.  There is ZERO energy.  No talking.  No laughing.  Nothing but rows of guys sitting and looking blankly at the dancers.We found some empty chairs in the back, and settled in there, and I was able to turn my attention to the girls.  Ok, look:  I know they can't all be Elizabeth Berkley (may the Lord keep her feisty Nomi Malone safe and warm forever).  But I didn't expect this apathy.  Bored looking women taking their short turns on the small round main stage, and more bored looking women walking around offering lapdances in vain.  The thing about stripping is this:  I thought the point was that you could make a lot of money.  But we were there at midnight on a Saturday night, and these girls were getting NOTHING.  In the hour we were there, I saw ONE man put money in a girl's pants on stage... and I watched, and it was a one dollar bill.  Seriously.I sat there with my 3 friends (2 men, one other woman), all of us in a row, all of us suddenly sober, staring with our eyes and mouths wide open.  I could feel my male friends' good mood deflate (ha!  don't be dirty), as my girl friend and I felt like gender traitors just by being there.I thought these kind of places were supposed to be rowdy and fun.  Was I expecting too much  It was the most depressing experience.   I sort of feel bad even writing this, because nobody involved with that joint can be happy, I'm sure.

            "Translated: Picture it, if you will.  Little old me, drinking at the Bikini Lounge from 2 in the afternoon until midnight with 3 friends.  Drinking, drinking, drinking.  So after 10+ hours of living solely off of beer, there can surely be no better idea than going to a strip club.  RightSo we pack up and head on over.  A high cover (sorry, for the life of me I don't remember how much) and a 2 drink minimum (which I do realize is standard) later, we're immersed in black light.  As my eyes adjust, I start to see that this is really not the crowd I expected to see in a strip club.  There is ZERO energy.  No talking.  No laughing.  Nothing but rows of guys sitting and looking blankly at the dancers.We found some empty chairs in the back, and settled in there, and I was able to turn my attention to the girls.  Ok, look:  I know they can't all be Elizabeth Berkley (may the Lord keep her feisty Nomi Malone safe and warm forever).  But I didn't expect this apathy.

Nothing, and I mean NOTHING is as bad as this club. The New York City bouncer out front was a nice guy, and thats where it stopped. The girls here are downright disgusting. These girls don't even look good enough to work the counter at MVD. The place is also crawling with undesirables at all times of the day and night. Their drinks are about $7 for a captain and coke, there were no girls dancing when we were there, the three girls who were working were basically asking if we wanted dances and when I said no, then rolled their eyes and walked away. Well, maybe these girls could dance on stage and THEN ask for a private dance... I want to see what you're made of first.The dress code out front, the disgusting women, the attitude from bartenders, and the overall grossness of this place earn it a one star. It would be negative one if it were an option. Hi LIter, Bombshells, and even Cheetah's are a ton better than this place. They are cheaper, have better talent, and are very friendly places.

Hot chicks everywhere so I slowly drift off into Candyland...ahhhhhh.  Little did I know that the wolves were slowly working on one young pup.

Okay, now maybe it was at least 10 songs with full nudity, but how do rack up $1000 for lap dances  BullSh*t!My buddy's pup signed the credit card receipt so there was nothing to contest except that our young apprentice got taken.  Little \"Sparky\" has a crappy job making $9 an hour, so this $1000+ lesson should be around for quite a while.  I had a great time, venue was cool but do the \"Little Darlings\" at Little Darlings have to feed on the young.  I was also taught that \"you get more bees with honey\".  I guess not.  Not sure if I would ever go back.  If you provide a wild and exciting time, the boys will come, however, this was all shady.  Definitely rubbed me the wrong way.  You only get one star cause I can't give you less...but then again you already took what you could.Advice, watch your young or leave the pups at home.  There are tons of other places to go in Vegas.

            "Original: After finding out that most strip clubs in Vegas were 21+ (Yes, in Cali almost all strip clubs are 18+ due to alcohol laws) my gf and I had no choice but to come to this lovely hole in the wall. 30 dollars cover charge, not bad for Vegas you know So I keep an open mind and take a step in..  The real problem for me was that  there wasn't really any \"stripping\" per say. The strippers would come out in their bathing suits.. then go to the back, take it off then come out completely naked. WTF Isn't stripping supposed to be sexy Stripping done right is an art, but all these girls would do was come out naked and do the SAME moves. They would shake their asses around repeatedly and of course all the horn dogs would drool and think its the best thing on earth. Yawn.There were also questionable role playing and dancing.There was an act of grim reaper.. Yes she came out in a grim reaper outfit (with the blade and all) I was confused and started laughing. There's nothing sexy about a grim reaper... Why not have a dominatrix or something that's more appealing There was also a strange part where they layed a blanket out and poured candle wax on their bodies.. Kinky Nope.... for some reason it was just gross. They were so unattractive, physically and personality wise. There were also 3 strippers that made a huge fuss on stage. They were wildly waving their arms around at each other because nobody tipped them while they were on their poles. They were all mad and they even went up to a guy and started yelling when he gave them two dollars. Then she proceeded to flip him off. Errr... people pay you to STRIP not to be a bitch. If you would just do your job and do it WELL, people would freaking tip you. Period. Overall, the girls were all around 6's. They were out of shape (stretch marks, pooches and tatts everywhere), unenthusiastic and looked miserable! I swear, some of them looked like they would rather go to jury duty then to be dancing at that club.. I don't know where this establishment got these \"dancers\" but for Vegas I was thoroughly disappointed. When I come back again in a few weeks (when I turn 21) hopefully I'll visit a real Vegas strip club such as Spearmint Rhino or Treasures.Save your money for quality guys!\n",

Finally at 2:30, after sitting in the hard floor for an hour they tell us they are going to start, so they begin with their schtick and \"rules\", this started to go on and on, it seems like they are frustrated comedians trying their material on this audience.  After 15 minutes I had to leave, because my kids could not take it any more.  I cannot blame them.  They were very good for one hour and 15 minutes of doing nothing but sitting on a hard floor.

There was no one available to tell you what you were looking at.  No signage of explanations of any sort.  How is this educational Please please do not waste your money.  You are better off watching YouTube videos or going to the library for information. Also, they had ants and bees.  Same thing no descriptions.  We walk into this tiny aquarium with maybe 3 fish tanks with 2 fish in them.  We saw one lady who asked if we were going to do some petting.. Um ok and proceeds to give us hand sanitizer. First of all what are we petting We put our hands in the water to pet what looks like a stingray No signage!!! No one is there to tell us anything!!! So disappointing.. Again, why is this educational The fish in the tank has a white piece of paper on the wall that looked like they had just printed it earlier that morning with the name of the fish.  That's it!! No other information about where the fish is from.. Nothing.  My husband made a comment.. Hey we eat that fish.  You can get that at the Asian market. Lol oh and when we waited to see the movie, a man came in and had to read off a piece of paper his welcome message which had nothing to do with the movie.  just about where the exits were.  Lol nothing to see here.  The only cool thing my kids got was a butterfly and caterpillar balloon that was not made by them (Willie's creations) because it was the grand opening weekend.  Also, the 3d flight of the butterflies movie was great for the kids, but not worth $60. I don't think so.  Save your money and go to desert botanical.  At least there are people who can give you information. Oh and need to add... It took us 35 min (not including movie) to see everything.  We had planned for this to be at least a 2 hr adventure for the price we were paying!!\n",

            "Original: I went on September 1st and I have to say I was miserable.  It was over 65.00 for two adults and a 5yr and 8yr old.  We waited in a long line front from the begining and then went to see a movie.  The movie was good and we did like that but everything else was poor.  This place is beautiful on the outside but a poor set up on the inside.  Hot and humid and the butterfly exhibit though beautiful had dead ends in each section, It would of been more functional to keep it going with the walk way so it was not so congested. Also the ant exhibit was horrible and the fish tanks were really no big deal.  We live in Arizona so we know what scorpions are.  Just think the fee to get in was way to much for what you were given.  The cafeteria cost 13.00 for two bags of candy and two juice boxes and then you leave thru the gift store which every kid was complaining as they wanted a toy or somthing.  Clever on the store part but not fair to the parents.  We bought a plastic butterfly ring and with tax as 4.91 for a 10 cent ring. I will never go back and I bet this will be closed down before to long.   Sorry but have to be honest.\n",

As annual members of Butterfly Wonderland they sent both me and my girlfriend an email that says this...\"As a member of Butterfly Wonderland we are extending a sneak peak at the newest must see in Scottsdale. Just print out this email and you will RECEIVE ONE COMPLIMENTARY WALK-THROUGH PASS.\"  Seems simple enough but it was at best a bait and switch and more accurately an outright lie.  Adding to the nastiness was a  discourteous staff that found pleasure in being very abrupt about telling us the offer was a mistake which they had no intention of honoring and was good only for a quick single walk through of only their laser area of the venue.  We had two choices.  Pay $9.95 plus tax  per person for each of us and our two children (6 and 4 years old) or we were free to leave. I paid the $43 bucks and we walked through the mirror maze. This Mirror Maze part is not worth the extra fee! My advice is to wait for the carnival to come to town.  The Mirror Maze you'll find in a carnival funhouse will be more entertaining and the carnie staff likely more courteous.\n",

Then I witnessed him talking to another female that appeared to be working the exhibit as well. He spoke loudly using the F-word so that everybody at the exhibit could hear. Finally he expressed that he was less concerned about the car and more about getting the picture back from the \"offender.\" What the HellI left shortly after that.

He paid full price & thought it was a private ride for 2. We ended up in a tiny balloon basket with a pilot & 2 young Asian girls. Lucky for him, he loved Asian girls...a LOT. I am not Asian. You can understand why this was an issue for me. I did not enjoy my bf smashing against 2 hot young Asian chicks in a basket for my birthday. Not the company's fault, but would be nice if they had informed him that there would be other people on our romantic champagne ride. He kept apologizing to me for this but it didn't help.To make it worse, the girls kept complaining about having gotten up early & talking about how they only went on the ride bc their dad paid 12 price for the ride via Groupon. Nothing like knowing my bf spend the equivalent of more than half his menial paycheck on a gift when the other people paid half price. Again, I know it's not the company's fault that some people don't look at Groupon, but it was just another negative on our trip.The pilot was...ok. Ex bf mentioned that I fly airplanes and from that point on the balloon pilot was very condescending toward me.Aside from the questionable company, the ride was strange as well. There is no real launch site. We got up at like 3:30 or 4 a.m. on my bday, drove to a location where we met the crew, then rode around in a van while they tried to figure out where we would launch. I don't know anything about hot air balloons, but driving around for a couple hours was pretty annoying. Guess it's how hot air ballooning goes So...expect that.Guess what you do after you wake up early and drive around with the crew and the hot Asian girls for a long time You put together their hot air balloon! That's right...it's a very Tom Sawyer kind of trick where they're like \"Hey, you're going to ACTUALLY help us built the balloon you're gonna fly in! It's so fun!\" Uhhh...It's not fun. It's work. And the little Asian girls were Scottsdale snobs and refused to help so...for my bday, I got to assemble a hot air balloon at the crack of dawn while one Asian girl stood and watched rolling her eyes and complaining and the other slept in the van bc these 18 year old girls partied too hard the night before. Ugh...The flight itself was fine. Uncomfortable for me bc of the weird situation being squished into a tiny basket with my boyfriend's Asian fantasy girls.I have never been in a hot air balloon before or after this, but the \"landing\" was pretty much a crash. We hit tree tops on the way down. We were told to brace for impact, and the touchdown was very violent. Dust and rocks flying everywhere while the ground crew tried to catch the ropes and help us to stop without tipping over.The \"champagne breakfast\" was the crew throwing out a basket of packaged muffins on a tailgate...think Otis Spunkmeyer style and some Sunny Delight with the option of champagne to mix with the Sunny D. Well...for the two of us who were over 21. Fantasy Asian chicks were like 18 so no ghetto Sunny D mimosas for them. They got in the van and slept while the crew packed up the balloon.So...it wasn't what he thought, wasn't what I thought, and we paid double the price of the other customers. It kinda sucked. Except for the Asian girls...their daddy bought them the ride and they got to sleep a lot and get checked out by my bf the whole time, so I guess it was ok for them.

I told her I was not going to pay for something I could not eat and should have been told that the mushrooms were canned and not freshVery disappointing food and waste of my time.The area this place is located in is not a very good area and I would advise people to not go after dark.\n",
            "Original: If I could give this place no stars, I would. The staff was absolutely the rudest set of people imaginable.  The server, who had the sloppiness of a self dressed 3 year old there who claims to be new and doesn't know the menu, also claims to be the manager. Go figure. We sat down at 715 and walked out by 9, that's how long it took for our meal. I ordered 5 pieces of byrek and the waitress brought it up on herself to only bring out 3 because she said it was too much food for the amount of people I had.......ummmmm okay. So I said that I still wanted the original order of my 5 total and then she said they didn't have any more. So basically lied to my face about it. Amongst the other issues that happened that evening, I got my salad at the end of the meal,  after I got my check by the way! So I proceeded to explain that I didn't want the salad because we were already leaving and she refused to take it off of my check even though I literally received it after I got my check, i figured fine I'll deal with it. Then she charged me for all 5 pieces of byrek when I only received 3. She solved this issue by telling me I ordered 5 so that's what she charged me for, even though I only received 3. I also ordered a $9 plate and she charged me $10 for it. Basically she was so incompetent that she couldn't look at the menu and charge me the prices that were right there in front of her face.When she refused to just take a second look at my check so I could show her that i clearly had gotten over charged , she handed me a business card and told me to call her another day because she was done talking to me about what the issue was. Luckily I had cash so i paid her for exactly what i had ordered.The whole scenario of a Bosnian themed place is mediocre,  it looks dirty and not well kept. They had sesame street, wrapping paper table cloths, who the hell uses wrapping paper as a table cloth. The table was dirty when we sat down, mind you we were the only table they had initially. There was an employee drinking beer while he was working. This place was a disaster. It's extremely pitiful because the food wasn't half bad but i can not tell you how horrible these employees were especially the waitress who could not even comprehend a 9 key register and spoke 25% of the English language. She should seriously be in the back of the store so you wouldn't have to see that horrible wretched face of hers. I'm in the same line of work, and if I ever treated someone who came to my restaurant with that kind of utter disrespect I would fire myself! !\n",

            "Original: Is it just me or do restaurants in Montreal just like to take their sweet timeArriving after 8 with a party of 12, we were told that it was a busy night but things shouldn't be much later than usual.. fair enough.After our server skipped passed us many many times assuming that we were waiting for some people when we had told him we weren't waiting.... we put in our food.I ordered a green salad  $6 and there was NOTHING in it except greens that seemed like it had come from a boxed salad from Costco. I had asked for a large portion but he indicated that it was quite big, forming  a ball. Too bad this ball was pretty much full of air as the greens had no extras - cucumber, onion, tomato... JUST GREENS.While our table was split into 2 groups of 6, the consistency of service was terrible. Table 1 got appies, and approximately 5 minutes after, table 2's main course had come out.... which is understandable because they must've been super hungry (probably after 9). As we were finish our appies, our server said that he didn't want to rush us and asked if we would like our main courses to be put in. We were so hungry - of course yes. We thought he was going to bring out our main courses.... but NO. he had not even punched the order into the kitchen yet! ......... it was probably another 40 minutes before Table 1's mains came out, and by then Table 2 is already eating dessert. We were so hungry to the point that we were not even hungry anymore. When we called the waiter over, he looked so nervous and had no answers for us as he hurried back into the kitchen in the hopes to get us something to eat.. let me say that all our food options were either raw, rare, or lightly seared. Not sure what took so long.The mains came out probably 10:30. We were not hungry anymore. My salmon tartare with avocado and lemon oil was sub par. It was 2 3 avocado puree and the lemon oil tasted like water. Although other people thought the food was good, I could have really had a good meal elsewhere without the wait time.Not going to write anymore. There's nothing more to say. The thought of thinking about this makes me sad.\n",

            "Original: If you are in the mood for rude service, from a manager nonetheless, then this is the place for you. We had a party of 12 come here for dinner. We ordered food (not that great), appetizers and plenty of drinks. On their menu, it clearly says that drinks with double alcohol are $8, which we thought was quite the deal. So two friends of mine had two drinks, with double alcohol each. Totalling 4. Still with me Good. So when the bill came, you'd think the two drinks per person would be $16 each. No. They neglect to tell you that it's $8 per alcohol shot, not the entire drink. So those two drinks ended up costing a hefty $32 per person! When this was brought up to the waitress, she brought over the manager who was a rude little french troll. He was sarcastic, loud and didn't know what it meant to please the customer. After explaining why we were charged that much, he just wouldn't listen to our explanation of how deceiving their menu is when it comes to that drink special. It just didn't get into his thick skull. At one point, sarcastically he said \"what do you want me to do, call the owner at home and have him come explain this to you\". Fellow yelper Lourdes W. gave him a piece of her mind saying how rude he was being and that he had no tact. He needed to address his customer's concerns in a respectful manner and appease us since we spent quite alot of money with a party of 12. This shut him up and we decided to just pay the bill and leave. For sure my friend will be calling their credit card to contest the charge. Say what you want about America and it's customer service skills, but something like this would have never happened in the states. Our economy may be in the gutter and our crime rate may be increasing but pleasing the customer at restaurants is something that is always honored wherever you go. Stay away from this dump.\n",

            "Translated: I am giving this place zero stars.  My grandmother was sent to this hell hole, to build and regain strength. After being at TLC for almost 10 days,  my grandma had been vomiting large amount of green vomit for days, Her blood pressure was finally checked and it was so low, they rushed her to Er. My grandma is now laying in ICU, with the worst Pneumonia one can have. All of this is caused by lack of staff members doing what they are paid to do.

Once again the Solari rep showed up only this time she stated that she could only stay 2 days in Solari. Moved her the following day.

            "Original: My father passed away early this week at the Silver Ridge Healthcare Center after a 9 year bout with cancer. It was his dying wish not to pass at home while he was in home hospice care so when the medical staff tending to him announced that he only had hours left, arrangements were made to have him transferred to a hospice based facility. I hope and pray that if you (the reader) are ever faced with sending a family member or friend to a facility like this - that you have other options because Silver Ridge is one of the worst facilities I've encountered after years of working in Healthcare. I waited a few days to post this so it wouldn't seem like an emotional response to my father's passing - I truly hope that no one ever has to experience what I experienced here.To start off - I could have raised hell but that wasn't my purpose for being there. I was there, with my family to be with my father in his last remaining hours. But, from the moment I stepped foot into the facility, I encountered the most cold, uncaring and unprofessional staff ever. I intentionally used the word \"encountered\" because not one person ever approached my family. Not one asked if we needed anything. Not one offered any explanation of the procedures and or rules of the facility. Not one gave us the time of day when coming by to check his vitals or drop off equipment, which incidentally, was never used. It was so bad that when the transport team arrived to transfer my father to his assigned bedroom - one of them had to go and hunt down a tree so they could connect the oxygen lines. When I finally wanted to know what the hell was going on, I find three of their staff just sitting at the station having a non work related conversation. There were problems with the meds that my father was prescribed but it wasn't entirely the facility's fault - but no one on their staff, took the initiative to try to remedy the situation. Meds at facility are brought in via a mobile pharmacy team however, all facilities have systems in place for meds they need stat and this place was not exception. After a brief conversation with the admitting nurse, and some pointed accusations about how inept their staff was coming across - she managed to contact the right people to pull the meds from their Pyxis machine that had the meds my father was prescribed, in stock. Almost two hours after my father was placed. At one point, one of the nurses came in to take my father's vitals. Both my sister and I were sitting bedside and not only didn't she even greet us or explain what she was doing - when asked what his stats were, she didn't even answer - she only turned the monitor so I could see the readout. The patient next door - didn't speak English. I don't know what language he spoke however, the staff on the third shift, had zero patience for dealing with him. At one point, one of the nurses was arguing with him because of the language barrier. I don't understand how someone in Healthcare doesn't know how to use the free translation services offered to help prevent circumstances like what I witnessed that night. It's a matter of a making a toll free call. I could go on about this place however, there were some things you would just have to see for yourself. For example, the unsanitary restrooms - where soiled adult diapers were overflowing from the trash cans onto the floor. There were also some spills that weren't cleaned from the patients who had the pleasure of roaming the halls. I will close on this - when my father passed, not one word was said to my family by the staff. It's not like there wasn't time nor opportunity. Waiting for the mortuary service to pick him up took about 90 minutes. Even the transport driver was sympathetic enough to offer condolences. I remained silent about what I witnessed first hand at first. This isn't the only arena I intend on voicing my concerns. I over see hospital operations on a much larger level than this facility but the term \"Healthcare\" should be universal everywhere. Until the facility's management address the issues here, I'd recommend you avoid this place if you need to place a loved one there for care.\n",

            "Original: SNR is a somewhat older facility but we went with this one given the staggeringly bad reviews the other one got. My grandma in law fell from being weak from a UTI and had to be transferred to a rehabilitation to recover and get stronger.  It seemed really great at first but it was the luck of the draw we got a really lovely RN and CNA team the first few days and then the shifts changed. Overall the care for someone who can't ask for help as well as others was inadequate.  There were some wonderful people along the way that we really liked and we expressed so much gratitude to them for their kindness. Then there was the polar opposite that have yelled at us for requests that I feel were reasonable. One lady go mad at being told to be more gentle with grandma as she fell and being turned so quickly hurts. One got mad at being asked an hour later if she got the ice water and can change grandma before leaving. When we've been there for 12 hours and want to go home and said so when making the request, I would hope to get stuff in a reasonable time, not an hour later ask to be yelled at that not everything can happen at a snap of demands. World doesn't revolve around us. Some things can't be helped, I'm not unreasonable. I've heard complaints down the hall of how spread thin people can be. Too many people assigned to a person - I sympathize and not OK with how the bottom dollar comes into play with quality care. It fucks staff and patients. If you can speak for yourself and press your button, then you'll be fine. If you can speak for yourself also be considerate of how much time you take for your trivial BS. One of our neighbors was a princess and spent so much time demanding and berating the staff that maybe if they didn't get beatdown they would care more, and have more time for what matters.I think though even in that, prioritize. When someone has a UTI and is too weak to get up, don't leave them in their waste all night. Grandma got some serious rashes from this....and things didn't change with some people. It's totally not OK that it takes us being posted up at the rehab to make sure she was being cared for.The weekend director was wonderful and when she was around, my MIL got somewhere with asking for some better priority treatment of the rashes and to get grandma on IVs and better meds. The physical therapist did all they can daily. Their case worker is a very sweet woman that lead us down to hospice as a option.At the end of it, we saw she was in pain and giving up on us. The person who came in declined and didn't want this anymore. We made the decision to bring her to hospice for adequate care. Our thought process is they would take better care of her there, and discharge her to at home comfort care. I think her spirit was broken, she didn't want to go on and she left us 48 hours after leaving this facility and was thanking us for getting her out after the hospice immediately did in 11 minutes what didn't happen here for 11 days. There they bathed her, made her comfortable the moment she arrived. Of course the maybes play into my head. If we had better care from the start, I think she would have been better off...\n",

After she was back doing well and could be released from the hospital once again, Sante apologized for the incident and assured us that they would now know how to properly work it and care for her.  We mistakenly once again had her go there.  She was doing great; however, they were not able to work the bipap yet again and did nothing to get another machine or anything.

They did not allow my grandma to go to the hospital as she was asking to go along with us.  They told her that she did not want to go to the hospital because you know what happens there.  Well they neglected to even call 911 even when in the middle of the night her oxygen levels dropped into the 60's.  Nothing got done until my dad went by the next morning and immediately told them to call the ambulance.  They listened only because they thought that he was a dr.  They were clueless and didn't even know who the dr.'s were just as they are clueless when it comes to providing care.  All that they were good for was popping pills down my grandma's throat.  All thanks to Sante my grandma is worse off now than before and is fighting for her life this very moment.  I highly suggest avoiding Sante at all costs.  They lie, don't care properly for their patients, and are only money hungry.  If you love your loved one do not allow them to so much as set a foot in this facility!!\n",

As we were checking out I noticed a bin that was full of bags that had sports watches and body bands to monitor vital signs. I started going through them to find a watch that would meet my workout needs. Most of the bags that contained these watches were missing something. Not a problem because the outside clearly noted what was wrong with the package. It said things like \" missing manual or dead battery\" I found a watch that was missing a manual. I went online and looked up the watch and it had what i was looking for. I purchased the watch as is and took it home. After trying to sync the watch to the body strap monitor for an hour, I went online and found that the watch that i have takes an analog strap and the one that was in this bag was digital. I went back to the store today to swap out the wrong band for the correct on. I was told that i had to speak to Nicole the store manager. I was directed to Nicole who was assisting another customer. After standing patiently waiting for Nicole while the customer and Nicole discussed trading in his older wife for two younger ones, I got annoyed. I went back to the counter to find a different manager. I was told that Nicole is it. I waited some more. After waiting for Nicole for 15 minutes and listening to conversation that had nothing to do with products or services she asked how she could help me. I explained the situation and showed her the online picture of what i was supposed to receive with my purchase and she told me that they take everything out of the original package and put them into the bags that they sell these in.   i pointed out that as people look through the bag,   watches are being mixed up. I showed her Timex watches with Polar band and bags with two watches and no bands. Some watches had no bags at all and were sitting in the bottom of the bin with other loose manuals and straps. After going through each bag, I could not find the correct band. Someone is walking around with a digital watch with an analog band. I asked if i could purchase a more expensive watch and just pay the difference. Nicole said no. I get \"as is\" but I purchased it because the issue that was advertised on the packaging was it was missing the manual. It did not say that the accessories in the packaging do not match and the watch can not be used for anything except time and date.Now I have to pay for a new band as well as pay for shipping which is going to be more expensive than buying the watch at the original retail price. Thank you for horrible customer service and a useless watch.Pissed of Morrison Family YMCA Soccer Dad\n",

            "Original: I've been to several Dick's sporting good stores and this one is by far one of the worst. A few years ago I took my mountain bike to them for a basic service. Upon picking it up I realized that my high end pedals had been switched with some of the ones they use on their floor. I brought this up to the staff's attention who didn't hesitate in saying that I was wrong and they don't do that. I asked to speak to the manager an nobody was there from the management staff. I asked them to go review their security footage and they said they didn't want to do that either. I took this issue up their corporate ladder and all they did was apologized.I since stopped frequenting them. Sadly due to lack of options from a similar retailer in the areaI had to visit this location again recently, I had a backpack on as I rode there in my motorcycle. I walked in the store and started headed to the department I was needing, I was stopped by a rather unpleasant employee who told me I could not be in the store with a backpack due to recent theft issues. I told her that I had been in other dick's sporting goods and was never made aware of such rule. I also informed her that there was no signage stating that as I walked in the store. She continued to state that I could either give them my backpack or I could leave the store!!!!I told her that neither option worked and that she could inform her security staff to watch me on camera or have someone follow me around as I did not feel comfortable giving them my backpack which had my valuables in it.This brand has high prices and the staff isn't very knowledgeable nor very pleasant. They are definitely missing the point of retail on so many levels it's pathetic.I wish there were other options of stores similar to them in the area.\n",

            "Original: Today, I had a terrible experience at Monona's Village Pedaler. i arrived at 10am as the shop opened. I needed to simply pump up a tire on my nephew's bike. I had trouble getting to the air value due to a spoke that was a little to snug to the value. Very simple issue....I walked in and there was a white lady getting her bike fixed. Another white lady and a white gentleman came in after me. The first lady bike was serviced. I was clearly next. The guy working there looked past me and serviced the white lady before me! It was clear that I was next, but he didn't serve me. I patiently waiting thinking something was strange. He then asked me what I needed. I explained and we walked to the pump. He started to pump the air into the value, stopped 12 way through, and went to help the white gentleman. He just left me standing there. He got a set of tires for the man and left me wondering what I had done. I walked back in the shop wondering what was going on. I stood next to the gentleman. As the worker charged the man's credit card in the front of the store, the customer looked at me and apologized for the man working. He thanked me for my patience and went along. Again, we went to the pump and the worker finished pumping up the front tire. I proceeded to ask him if he would squeeze the back tire to see if it needed air too. He refused to do it, telling me that I 'should know how to do it.' He told me that 'this is a simply life skill that I should already know how to do'. Huh I said, 'In your professional opinion, would you suggest that I add more air to the tire'. He replied with a short, crisp, snotty attitude, \"you feel the front tire and it (the back tire) needs air, do it\". Wow!!!!!...and he walked back in the store, leaving me by myself. I'm serious, I stood there shocked and wondering what was happening.I am an African American professional who wanted to take my nephew on his first Monona-lake bike ride. I didn't deserve service like this. If you don't support discriminatory business, stay away from this shop! He didn't need to treat me with such disregard. They don't deserve your money.

            "Original: I was purchasing a book for a class that I was unsure about staying in. While checking out, I asked the sales clerk what the return policy was and she completely ignored me. I asked a second time and she acted like I wasn't there and continued ringing me up. My friend, who was with me in line, sees slips of paper behind the register with the return policy on it and takes one since it was obvious that the cashier was not going to speak to us and points out that the return deadline for all text books was a few weeks away. I complete the transaction and leave. After I drop the class and try to return the unused book two days later, I'm told that the item is nonreturnable. The manager pointed out the fine print in the return policy that listed many types of books that were nonreturnable. There were many paragraphs of text on their return policy and the part that listed the deadline for book returns was no where near the part that stated my book was nonreturnable. I pointed out that the cashier completely ignored my question about the return policy and the manger, beaming with pride, tells me that they train their employees to not answer any questions about their return policy! I don't need to explain how absurd that is. He goes on to explain that they \"[...] expect our customers to know how to read.\" What does TIS expect us to know how to read, the lengthy return policy that is not provided to the purchaser until *after* they check out unless they simply reach around the register and take one There are very good reasons why they don't provide the policy to customers--even when asked. Besides being able to sell books to students unsure about staying in their classes--if even a small number of customers took the time to read the lengthy return policy before they check out, the line would be hours long rather than the mere 45 minutes that it took for us. TIS is as sleazy as they come. Save some money and order online!\n",

This afternoon I attempted to return the unopened product with the original receipt. I was told they could offer me $19.00 for it, as it was considered a \"textbook\" (for the record, an iClicker is an electronic device made of plastic and metal, and made up of 0% paper) and therefore not eligible for return after August, despite the fact that I had purchased it in September and not during August at all. The cashier who checked me out at the time of purchase also did not inform me that I would not be able to return it.

A few months ago, my fiance and I stopped into the store to get an idea on a suit for me for our up coming wedding.  We first met the son, who was very nice and knowledgeable.  I recently returned to the shop when it was time to finally purchase a suit as our wedding is getting close.  I was helped by Maragita, and sold a nice suit. She initially gave me a good deal, and I felt satisfied with the experience.  LET ME TELL YOU HOW THINGS CHANGED ONCE THEY'VE GOT YOUR MONEY!!!!! The suite was ordered from the manufacturer, and arrived about ten days later. When I went to pick it up, I tried it on for any necessary alterations.  I was quoted an extra $115 to make it fit.  Now I understand all suits need some alterations, but this was major work needed.  I took the suit, to get some comparison quotes to fit it, which were cheaper.  I decided to return to the shop to see if the would work with me in coming to an arrangement since I was not happy with the way the experience was going.  A $200 suit, now was costing me $315, when i was under the impression that any alterations were included.  I expressed my displeasure with Margarita, who became very defensive.  I explained that I felt lead a stray in buying the suit since I tried the pants on in front of her and she knew how much alterations the would need.  I understand that alterations are time consuming and people aren't going to work for free.   I suggested a 50% discount and offered to pay $65, to meet me in the middle.  She did not accept this, and was unwilling to work with me at all in satisfying my displeasure.  She even had the attitude that it was some how my fault for not knowing how these things work.  I informed her that she wasn't really doing much to keep me business, and she stated that she had many happy customers and didn't need my return business.  CUSTOMER SERVICE AND SATISFACTION IS NOT A CONCERN FOR THIS STORE.  MARGARITA HAD NO INTEREST IN TRYING TO WIN MY REPEAT BUSINESS. ONCE THEY HAVE YOUR MONEY, YOU'RE OWN YOUR OWN.

I felt helpless, knowing I didn't have anymore time to go anywhere else. The owner Mikka was shaking in disgust that I would even challenge her. Now keep in mind, I had 10 men and 4 boys in my party.( 2 little boy's aged 2 and a 9 and 12 year old) I asked her again \"why was she trying to charge full price for children\" She then said \" the lower price was for size 12 and under not age.\" So I was forced to pay the full price and left. Felling helplessness,  I reached out to my CC company, who to no avail told me there hands were tied because it was a verbal agreement not a written one.So at the end of the day, I'm left with this bill and a taste so bad in my mouth about this store and the owner. Buyer beware. Go to another store, one that will honor there verbal agreements. I will never shop with this store again and I recommend you do the same.\n",

            "Original: Don't waste your money.  Bought an $1,800 suite here last September and it's already falling apart in less than 1 year.  It's LITERALLY FALLING APART.  The fabric is worn in the crotch and the seams are showing severe signs of wear and tear.  I've never had it dry cleaned and have only wore it 3-4 times per month in the last 10 months.I was initially reluctant to purchase from Stiched in the first place because of their shady reviews regarding their tailoring.  When I addressed these issues to their staff prior to my purchase the sales man used phrases like \"we have new tailors\", \"those are old reviews\", and \"we now have the best tailors on the strip\". Don't be fooled!  When trying to come to an amicable resolution with the manager 10 months later, he too said \"I'm sorry and we stand behind our product\".  This was B.S. because he didn't care about resolving this issue in a reasonable manner.  Shame on you Stiched.  I've had suits from the Men's Wearhouse that have lasted much longer. The only resolution that the manager offered was that he'd sell me another pair of pants (that won't match the existing jacket) at a discounted price.  I'm sorry but this is completely unacceptable.  I will never buy from Stiched again nor would I recommend you gamble with their product.\n",

The gym and staff are great.  however, upon losing my job, i was told i need to send a letter asking for cancellation.   I sent the letter and it appeared the matter was over.  They have continued to bill me $149month for over a year now.  they send me to their collections department when i don't pay.  Each person i talk to on the phone says i need to mail a letter or they cant cancel.  they also say that they need 30 days notice to cancel.  This is a scam to keep you going from month to month and to keep taking your money.   In total they have stolen $1500 from me and my family.  I have contacted corporate and they say they have done nothing wrong and can't help.  \"the money is for access to they gym, it doesn't matter that you haven't been to the gym in over a year.

We found the rollaway we had requested (and paid for) not present, and I went back down to the old gentleman. He stared at me and then went back to pecking at his computer. I waited. Suddenly he looked up at me and started yelling, something to the effect that there wasn't anything that he could do, and that he would see if someone could do something but probably not. He also angrily admitted that the reservation did show the rollaway.I slunk away with my guest who had by now come down, too, embarrassed and insulted. It shouldn't be this way. If this is personalized service, I'd rather stay at a motel.Even without grumpy old man, there's nothing special about this place. The rooms were ok, but the bathrooms tiny (I guess they should be called showerrooms). Everything else was sub-par. The dining room breakfast was served in was tacky and the coffee awful. We did not dare try the free wine. The hotel is in a bad neighborhood.For the money, find a special at the William Penn on the Omni Hotels website. If you want a boutique hotel, try the Inn on the Mexican War Streets--a beautiful building with friendly owners just across from the National Aviary and that beautiful park.

            "Original: We stayed here and was initially disappointed-- being new to town, our first impression was that Pittsburgh was a very very bad town full of homeless and degenerates (the area, I find out later, is one of the worst spots in the city!).  The hotel is located across the street from a housing authority building.  Projects  UGH.  Great.  Then we were put into a \"historical\" room that was similar to that of a rundown cheap apartment-- old shower stall, moldy threadbare carpeting, lumpy squeaky bed.  I find out an hour later (after freaking out about the lo-end aspect of this room) that they have new rooms that were just recently renovated.  I asked to see the room, and then ultimately change to that room-- for a fee, of course.  About 50% more expensive.  But I pay more because NO WAY would I be able to exist in this old \"historical\" creepy room.  Finally, a regular room-- the \"renovated\" room was similar to that of an acceptable hotel room.  Why even keep this historical, old, dingy, dirty room  Do they figure unsuspecting people who don't know any better will just accept it bc they have no other choice I slept well in the \"new\" renovated room, and would have been freaked out all night in the old room. What a difference. Actually, the bed and linens were very, very comfortable.  The bathroom was nice and clean.  The room was what I expected a hotel room to be... not high end four seasons, but not cheap and nasty either. The hotel obviously had availabilities of the new, renovated rooms, so why put us in an old, unrenovated, ugly old apartment looking room If they believed in upgrading, then they would have at least gotten repeat business!! For those who are going to book here, pay more for the new rooms, or go somewhere else.  The option of staying in the old room should not be an option at all.  I don't think I will ever go back here if I ever go back to Pittsburgh.  I will stay at a chain hotel-- marriot or whatever.  What is money except a means to be comfortable and live  I will spend more next time.Breakfast was \"eh\".

            "Original: We decided to have a little staycation at the Priory earlier this month.  My husband made the reservation with a special they were having for a dinner date night.  With the special, they give you a few Pittsburgh restaurants to choose from and you get a $50 voucher to that restaurant.  When my husband called the Priory, they said they would make the reservations and call us back on the time.  We never got a call about the reservation time which was annoying.  But the main issue was we checked in, talked to the girl at the front desk about having the shuttle take us to this reservation at Meat and Potatoes, and she set us up with the shuttle.  We go in the room, look around for the $50 voucher, and it's not in the room so we assumed (i know we should never assume) that it was taken care of with Meat and Potatoes when they  made our reservation.  We had a fabulous dinner at M&P, great food, great service, and the bill comes.  We asked the server about this Priory $50 voucher and he had never heard about it so the manager comes over and says they didn't give them anything but to have them call and ask for him and he'll work it out.  We called the Priory and told them this, the girl who answered gave us an attitude and said you should have asked for it.  Then refused to call M&P to talk to the manager.  She just said to pay the full bill and we can work it out when we get back to the hotel.  We gave the manager our phone and he was yelled at as well about this.  He took our word that the Priory would deliver it to him the next day and he deducted the $50 from our bill.  It was embarrassing and it wasn't the issue with the money, just the service with the priory.  This showed us two things: We won't be going back to the Priory due to the lack of service and lack of respect and we WILL be going back to M&P because their service was impeccable.\n",

            "Original: Went to a High Tea here on Sunday.  Although the setting was lovely and the staff was welcoming, the food was nothing special, in fact, it was bad.  We were served three tea sandwiches:  egg salad, which was bland (I make a better version at home), chicken salad, nothing special either, and then a delicious spinach-artichoke bite.  Unfortunately, it was the size of a quarter, it was literally a bite.  But it was the best part of the meal!!!  (I don't think the size of all three of the sandwiches put together was as big as one piece of white bread).We were offered two types of scones:  cranberry and eggnog.   Neither was anything special, eggnog had absolutely no taste whatsoever!Then, the pastries:  we were served a gingerbread cupcake which was fine--nothing like Vanilla Pastry Shop!  A pumpkin torte, again, fine.  And a chocolate moussebrownie bite with a raspberry and candy cane on top--it was dry as a bone!  It looked as if it was on it's last legs--chocolate was turning white, mouse separated from brownie.  Yuck.  Oh yeah--I had a delicious tea from Harney and Sons (used to be sold at the Grand Floridian High Tea in Disney World), cinnamon spice!!!  Unfortunately, when I asked for more tea, they gave me new hot water and the same old tea bag! I've gone to various teas so I feel I can give a good comparison.  Not impressed at all!

We had both heard good things about the place and that they had a great martini menu.  When we arrived there, however it was a different story.  We were met at the door by the hostess (I presume) who did not take our arrival kindly and seemed annoyed that we were there.We shrugged it off and went to the bar.  The bartender was something else and it seemed as if he was on a variety of drugs. He acted as if he was on the last quaaludes in his posession and moved with a subtle grace most often reserved for Miss Universe pageant constestants.  And that's saying something.The bartender would disappear for long periods of time, during which we would hear odd sounds coming from the kitchen.  Mostly the sounds of silverware banging around.  It was as if the hostess and bartender were throwing cutlery at each other in attempts to get us to think just what the hell was going on.  We were there for about 2 hours  and during that time saw the bartender a total of 4 times.  Most of the time he was hiding out in the kitchen.  Even when it came time to get our check, it took about 15 minutes for him to return with my card.Terrible service that night from an otherwise reputable place.  I have no plans on returning.I hope this isn't deleted again, and if it is, I will make sure it's well known and will take printed copies of this and put them up around Sunnyledge and use every contact I have to get this printed in the Post Gazette and City Paper.

            "Original: *For the barWhile looking for places to have Easter brunch, I saw the Sunnyledge appear several times in my searching. They no longer do easter brunch, but they do have their martini bar - which many people seem to rave about. I should have stopped to think twice upon seeing that all 5 reviews here on yelp are at least 2 years old, but I threw caution to the wind and arrived early on a Friday evening.Just getting off work, I came alone. The location is a historical landmark, a mansion built in 1889, and is the reason they deserve their single star. The mansion, from the lobby in the bar appears beautifully kept. The walls are dark and decorated with wood and stained glass. The furniture is elegant but not stuffy, and the bar was obviously once a den or a library that was converted. The bar is rather small, housing four 2-seat tables, a 4-top, and about 8 spaces at the bar. Behind the bar, light shines through a small collection of liquor bottles. The top of the bar and tables are inlaid with tile patterns and candles are spread throughout.I browsed the martini menu, not finding much that would suit my palate as it all sounded sweeter, or too far from a martini(tequila, cointreau, and orange juice is closer to a margarita than a martini - and that Jose Cuervo on your top shelf doesn't send a good impression of your margarita). I stuck with the classic, then, and ordered a basic dry gin martini without garnish. It was made quickly and without love, shaking instead of stirring, and putting it in an un-chilled glass. Not that there was much to love, while the bottles on the shelf could be called mid-range, the bottles used for my drink and for others were right out of the bottom of the barrel. Banker's Club is the gin of choice here, and Burnett's flavored vodka is the base of most of the drinks on their menu. The martini came(Not filled to the top, seems they measure precisely to include garnish), strong with little vermouth, but given the alcohol, devoid of any flavor but ethanol and a hint of citrus.I found as I drank that food is no longer available at all in the hotel as they no longer served as a restaurant, even though signage was still in place throughout the building. I quietly finished my drink and closed my tab. How much did my room temperature Banker's Club cost A cool $9.It appears that somewhere between the last two years and now, this hotel must have come upon hard times or new management. If you are staying at the hotel and need a drink, hop a cab to Walnut street. At least your hassle will be eased by a much better drink.\n",

The martini came(Not filled to the top, seems they measure precisely to include garnish), strong with little vermouth, but given the alcohol, devoid of any flavor but ethanol and a hint of citrus.I found as I drank that food is no longer available at all in the hotel as they no longer served as a restaurant, even though signage was still in place throughout the building. I quietly finished my drink and closed my tab. How much did my room temperature Banker's Club cost A cool $9.It appears that somewhere between the last two years and now, this hotel must have come upon hard times or new management. If you are staying at the hotel and need a drink, hop a cab to Walnut street. At least your hassle will be eased by a much better drink.\n",
            "Original: This was one of the vendors that came highly recommended by my wedding Planner. She could not stress enough how great and accommodating they were. From our first meeting with their Event Coordinator, we were lead to believe that MHI would offer outside catering if they were not able to customize our menu. We wanted traditional Laotian food. They said that this was possible and so we signed. Everything that transpired from that moment went downhill. They did not keep their promise and so we had to work with the Chef to prepare our dishes. After several tastings that we were billed for (it was never stated on our contract  that we had to pay for these), the food came out ok. The final straw was 2 weeks before our wedding when we got the bill that was to be paid in full,  which was completely inaccurate. They tried to explain to us and our wedding planner what the breakdown of cost was but nothing on that invoice made sense. My planner told us to hold off on paying until she spoke to Billy, the owner. She also mentioned that they had allowed a couple to pay on the day of so we should be ok. After several back and forth, we decided to proceed on the payment even though we didn't agree with the amount.  MHI Planner emailed us midday and said the owner, Billy, would not accept our credit card and demanded we paid him cash or money order in full or our event would be cancelled. We told him that the contract explicitly states that a cc is an acceptable form of payment and that he could take. He said that he would take us to court and sue us if we didn't pay. We were under the notion that he was going to cancel our event bc we refused to give in to his demands but two days later he ran our credit card wo our knowledge and called our planner to let us know all is well & that we could have our wedding day. We never got our money back and we ended up not having our wedding there. I don't think any bride & groom who endured what we did would want to have their wedding there as well. We had to find a new venue at the last minute and rejigger our wedding day schedule because of Billy. Folks - there is something sketchy when a business owner demands you pay in cash when the contract doesn't state that. Please beware of this. I have all of our correspondences saved if anyone wants to see them.\n",

            "Original: The Boggs Mansion (now called the Inn on the Mexican War Streets) was grand enough, and tastefully decorated.  We could have lived with the cold cookies, popcorn and cheap candies put out for snack; or even, the lack of basic room service. Perhaps we should have felt \"warned\" the first evening when we were escorted to our room and told that we could put out the \"Maid, please service the room\" sign, but that we shouldn't count on anything happening.  Perhaps we should have been \"warned\" when the innkeeper manically scribbled all over a map while \"explaining\" what to see and how to get around in that neighborhood.  No doubt, we should have been more alert to what we were being charged up front for our 5 night reservation, because the innkeeper wildly disclaimed ability to use a calculator and insisted on doing the sums by hand with a pencil and paper.  As a result, we were immediately overcharged by $111.66  from the amount we had agreed to in writing several months before.  All of this was not what we expected, and as trusting \"guests\" who wanted to have an enjoyable time, we ignored the \"issues\" and let the eccentricities slide that first night.  As others have written in their reviews, the breakfast is a self-serve affair which was your basic budget hotel big-box store fare, with the exception of some yogurt, hard-boiled eggs and a bowl of aging frozen mixed fruit.  All of this was counter indicated by anything we've experienced in Bed and Breakfast establishments in the past, but we were trying to have a good time and not make a fuss.  However, my husband and I both work from our computers when we are traveling, and I had specifically asked well in advance about wifi and internet connection before I made our reservation to stay for 5 nights at the Inn.  I had been assured that there was wifi and that it was free of charge. It says this in all the online ads for the hotel as well. Needless to say, we were taken aback the first night of our stay when it took us a long time to connect to the internet, and only when we figured out that we had to use a very old connection protocol.  When consulted, the innkeeper claimed he personally didn't have much use for the internet and was fairly indifferent to our requests for a decent internet connection.  On the second night, when we returned to our unserviced room, we discovered that there was no internet connection at all.  I went in search of Karl, the innkeeper, to help us, but he was nowhere to be found.  After struggling with the problem for quite a while, we gave up on trying to get any business done via internet. The next morning, while I was fetching our coffee and pastries from the breakfast area, Karl appeared.  I very politely told him the situation with the internet and asked if he would call the internet service provider to find out why there was no internet service to the house.  At first, Karl simply seemed indifferent and told me that our room could always get internet.  About two minutes later, out of the clear blue, he was screaming at me from the stair landing that I \"didn't know what it's like to work for a living because you've led a privileged life, could do anything you want, and had never worked a day in your life.\"  I stood in shock with the creamer in my hand over the Folgers!  Never in my life have I encountered such outrageous, presumptive insults; and certainly not from the host of a hotel to whom I'd paid good money to provide reasonable services and a comfortable time.  My husband witnessed this scene from the top of the stairs.  When I returned, quit shaken, to our room, we discussed the situation and agreed that we should leave.  After packing our traveling gear, my husband went in search of the innkeeper to explain that we would be leaving due to his intolerable behavior, and to request a refund for the three nights remaining.  After several minutes of calling all over the house for him, Karl finally crept out of a downstairs door.  My husband made his requests, and within seconds we both witnessed him fly into an insane rage once again, screaming nonsense which included insults of both of us and our home state, slamming doors multiple times, and then reopening the doors in order to follow us around while screaming at us to get out.  He only barely managed to come up with a refund slip, although it was for the wrong amount and was not processed correctly because of the faulty internet connection and because of his unwillingness to use a calculator for doing sums.  This whole scene and situation wasted many hours of a day of our long-anticipated vacation in Pittsburgh, but we were both happy to get away from so much insult and outrage.  We certainly would never recommend that anyone stay at the Inn on the Mexican War Streets.\n",

We WERE told, repeatedly, that the connection in our assigned room always worked, and that we were free to try other rooms.  It didn't work at all, anywhere in the Inn, the 2nd night.  (2) We were never offered assistance in finding another hotel in the area.  When we left the Inn, we had to go to McDonald's to get an internet connection in order to research other hotel possibilities for the 3 nights we were displaced. (3) The second night, we were the ONLY guests in the Inn, so there was no one else there to be \"understanding.\"  We were only informed about the death in Karl's family as he was demanding that we leave while screaming at us about being \"privileged\" and from California.   (4) We were charged $111.66 too much up front for the 5 nights when we arrived for our stay at the Inn.  To date, we are still waiting for that amount to be refunded.  It is certainly NOT TRUE that we received a refund for the nights we stayed, although we feel that kind of refund would be entirely appropriate considering the harsh treatment and lack of services.  We are sorry that the innkeepers see this as \"an inconvenience.\"  We see it as a very ugly and disturbing incident that ruined many hours of our time and cast a pall over the rest of our vacation.\n",

            "Original: My friends & I all purchased Groupons  for the Pittsburgh Improv on or around March 22nd, 2012. At that time, only a few big name comedians were listed on the Improv's website as Special Events. You can use the Groupon on anything that isn't a Special Event. That seemd reasonable. The day the Groupons were purchased, my friend Katrina called & reserved two tickets to Jim Jeffries for 330 at 10pm. They allowed her to use her Groupon & gave her a confirmation code & everything! Shortly after, they changed many of the comedians on their website, including Jim Jeffries, to Special Events. When I called I was told I could not use my Groupon. The same thing happened to many of my friends. It's a classic bait & switch. These comedians were NOT Special Events until after the Groupon came out. In addition, other restrictions, such not being able to use the Groupons on Saturdays & having to use the additional four vouchers for one show, were NOT listed under the restrictions when the Groupon was for sale. So tonight, my friends & I had pretty much resolved ourselves to the fact that we were not going to the Improv because they wouldn't allow us to use our Groupons. But I walked over to the Will Call window with my friend Katrina so she could at least get her tickets. Big surprise - she was told they didn't have her reservation or her name in their computers! They wouldn't give her the tickets. It's an absolute joke of a deal. How is everyone going to use their Groupons by Sept. if all of the shows are Special Events now In addition, no one at the Improv answers the phones or responds to emails. My friends & I (about 10 of us total) are all getting refunds through Groupon andor our credit card companies & we are all reporting the Improv to the Better Business Bureau, etc. The Pittsburgh Improv is extremely shady & does not care about their customers.\n",

            "Original: It isn't often that my wife and I get to go out, but we had tickets to see the WONDERFUL Lisa Landry and figured since we were going to the Improv, we may as well eat there too. I should have gotten on here and read the reviews before making that decision. We had what seems to be a typical experience at the improv. We were handed a paper menu with 4 items on it when we walked in the door. There was no other menu at the table and our waitress didn't offer us one either. She wanted our order, but as we were looking around the place, we realized that most of those around us were eating items that not on the menu provided to us. When asked about another menu, our waitress told us if we give her our drink order, she'll see what she can do. The table next to us handed over their menus so we had something to work with. Our drinks came, we finally put our orders in...and that was the last time we saw our waitress for almost a full 30 minutes. When she finally came back, all she wanted was to know if we wanted a 2nd round of drinks. After 30 minutes I was finally going to get a second beer! \"What about our food\", we asked. \"Oh\", was her answer. Now, according to the menu, dinner came with a side salad, a complimentary glass of champagne, and a chocolate mousse dessert. That's all good and fine. After a couple of minutes, someone, not our waitress, finally brought out our meals. When we asked him about our salads, his reply was \"do you want me to take your food back\". Really!! \"Do you want me to take your food back\" After almost 45 minutes at this point, we had received 1 round of drinks and had seen our waitress only twice and had just received our food. No, I don't want you to take our food back! Halfway through eating our meals, which were by this time cold, our waitress finally came back with our second beers. She asked us how everything was. We asked about our salads. She said she was told we didn't want them. REALLY!! Is this a joke Is it somehow part of the comedy routine that was going on Sadly, no. The service didn't get any better. The food was lousy. Thankfully the standup was great. Lisa, Lisa and Matt all put on a hilarious show. Will I ever go back Don't know. It took us an hour and a half to drive the 16 miles to get there, thanks to traffic. I do know that if we do it again, we will leave the house much earlier and eat somewhere else. The two drink minimum works at the improv because you will not get your waitress to your table more than that to order more drinks. In case you're interested, I am a chef who has been in the service industry for more than 30 years and worked every position possible in restaurants and bars. So, yes, I do have a preconceived notion as to how service and food should be. Even on Valentine's Day.\n",

So funny!!!By the way, the drinks were disgusting and we got yelled at for being to loud, it was as cold as a meat locker inside and once again except for Carlie and Doni the comedians ABSOLUTELY SUCKED!!!I enjoyed Carlie and Doni's performance they sang a few off songs about funny life expereinces like a bikini waxing. Warning, do your homework before stepping inside. Make sur eyou know the comedians on the line up and try to sneak in your own drinks. :)\n",
            "Original: WOW, was I disappointed.  We paid over the net and they had no listing when we arrived.  Got a table, ordered drinks only to be told we had to move because they had a party of 15.  several other couples were treated just as we were.  We got there 50 minutes early to get a good table. Then we had to  move.  Try watching a stand up act that you need to stand up to see it.  The table service was good.  First  3 acts was like high school entertainment.  The pics you see here are nothing like the place.  One room packed so tight you could not move. Classic case of squeeze the cash out of you.  Never again.  This is one of the most memorable birthdays I've spent.  Scottsdale should wake up.  Too much nice entertainment around for your dollars than this place.  Totally disappointed.  When we called before the show to confirm everything is set it turns out there is not a live person to be found.  Leave a message. The person at the door managing  Turns out he is one of the acts.  Can't believe they stay in business.  Had we been treated with repect it may have been an ok night.  My cash will be spent in other parts of Phoenix from now on.On a positive note the Marriot a few blocks away was fantastic!\n",

            "Original: This is a very dumpy club. Some closets, the bar area and the men's room might be bigger. I would call it intimate, but it has no intimacy, it is like an afterthought. They have one bathroom with one toilet each for men and women - that must be a code violation. It was like seeing a show in your buddies garage and a bad show at that. On this night, I donated 10 bucks to watch Bob Howard and Friends, which was actually some old lawyer moonlighting as a comedian. The rest of Bob's friends were old and older and I did not manage to laugh once, except at the dude who was wearing a fishing hat that Bob Newhart probably owned. That same moron would not accept my two buck off coupon at the door claiming it was a special night. A bunch of amateur comedians at a 6pm show does not sound too special to me. Out of respect for a date, I had to wait until after the show to heckle this guy. His whole 15 minute act was asking the front row of people what they did and making fun of them, an act of a child. I felt much better when I heckled him in the hallway, asking him if he knew any jokes and he had no response. The two drink minimum is not mentioned until you sit in your seat and on this night, the waitress overcharged me for a beer on special. She lost out on a tip. Poor staff, poor comedy, poor venue - go to a real comedy club, unless you are a good heckler because you might be star of the show at that point.\n",

            "Original: READ THE FAQ section!!!!   It contains crucial information that if you don't have, you could just lose out on the money you paid for tickets.No idea how there aren't more terrible reviews based upon the issue I had as well as the terrible...no...LACK OF customer service.Here's what happened to me. I know it's long, but it explains exactly the type of customer service and the type of shady business this place is:A buddy of mine was opening for some lady I've never heard of. I didn't care about the main act, but figured for $12 a ticket, I could sit through whatever came after his opening act, rightBought tickets the week before so I would be sure to have a ticket for the 8 pm show. This meant an additional $1 per ticket but I figured that was worth it to guarantee a seat. Day of, I had to work until 4 and again at 8 am, so I decided 8 pm would be better than 10. Ended up at work late, got home, showered, go ready, and hauled ass to the club which was about 30 minutes away. Got there at about 7:57 but the parking lot was full so we drove to a nearby parking area and walked over. As we were walking a couple was walking away and said kind of angrily, \"They're all sold out for this show!\" My boyfriend said, \"Thanks, but she already bought tickets.\" The woman replied, \"Yeah...so did we!\"Confused, we approached the doorman, printed receiptticket in hand. He informed us that they were sold out... ME: Riiiiiight...but we have tickets! DOORMAN: Sorry. You can either come back for the 10 pm show or email them for a refund.Meanwhile, the woman who warned us and her date came back over to ask more questions. We were all very confused about how buying tickets to a show doesn't mean that you have seats at that show. The doorman explained with the manager or owner or whoever the chubby old guy is, standing right there, that they recommend that you come a half hour before the show and get in line. Anyone in the front of the line with tickets at that time will get in, then they'll sell any remaining tickets to people in line who didn't pre-purchase tickets.So...there is really NO point in purchasing tickets before showing up because it makes no difference as to whether you get into the show. If people with no tickets show up before you and buy your seats, you're just out the money.Because I had to work the next morning, I opted not to attend the 10 pm show. I verified with the doorman that I could email for a refund, and he said yes. I told him the info regarding this reselling already purchased tickets should be on the receipt or should be made known to you. He informed me that \"it's on the website\".On the way home, my boyfriend got on the website and tried to find it. He eventually did...15 minutes later buried in the FAQs! I think that's BS. Why would I read all the FAQs if I didn't have any reason to A warning that they can sell your tickets to someone who shows up at the door before you should be more obvious and should be volunteered to you before you agree to purchase anything.In the FAQ section we also found the warning that sales are final and no refunds will be given at any time. Since the doorman had CLEARLY told us multiple times that we could email for a refund, I wasn't sure what to believe at this point. So...I called the club phone number. I figured if that were true, maybe we should turn back and try and make the 10 pm show. I got their voicemail and just left my name and number and requested a call back. I didn't even say why I was calling and they still never called back. Not that night. Not the next day. Not Monday morning. Not EVER. The next day I emailed the club for my refund just as the door guy said. Again...no response whatsoever. My next step was filing a complaint with PayPal who immediately escalated it. Eventually they informed me that they gave the club so many days (I believe it was...10 days maybe) to respond to several requests by PayPal to address my issue. They never responded (shocker!) so PayPal refunded my money. Luckily I was protected by PayPal and would've been protected by my credit card company as well. However, if it hadn't been for that, I would have been out $26 for a show I never saw. I don't know if most people read the FAQ section for every restaurant, venue, theater, stadium, etc... they attend but I don't. I probably will now, but I still think it's shady. When you buy tickets to a movie, baseball game, concert, etc...those tickets are yours  whether you show up early, on time or even late. I didn't know there was any place that buying tickets didn't guarantee you a seat.\n",

            "Original: TERRIBLE SERVICE!!! Only reason they got 1 star is because I cant go lower....My sister and I came to the Tempe improv for the first time sense its remodel. We came to see Ralphie May on a Wednesday night. The whole area was packed full of guest. We chose to sit on the end of the half booth half table. Many servers would come by and ask if we had more in our party so they could sit another couple in the seats, we did not, however every time they would put a couple in those seats the server would suggest they move because it was right in the walk way and people would be stepping on them the while time, or the people would ask to be moved because of the same reason. Right before the show began we had a couple that sat in front of us, only because they were the last seats available. We ordered our drinks and food at the same time, it took the server a bit to come over but we were fine just hanging out. Once we ordered, after he tried up-selling absolutely everything, we waited, and waited, and waited. We watched three tables who ordered after us get their food and drinks before we even got our drinks. The manager must have noticed my frustration written all over my face because he came over and asked if we had ordered. I said \"yes we did, about a half hour ago\". He apologized and we had our drinks about 10 minutes later. During the waiting of our food a server with a full tray of beverages spilled them all on the couple behind us. The customers were good sports and let it go. The ice tea my sister ordered tasted absolutely terrible, however it didn't much matter because I spilled it on her anyway. We tried maintaining the mess while servers walked by and and saw the mess yet did nothing. I finally got up and interrupted a server entering items into a register and said we have had a spill I need napkins. She didn't even look at me and said their are napkins right there. They were the small cocktail napkins your drink goes on..... so i took the whole stack, that got her attention! We cleaned up the mess ourselves and still waited on our food. The HORRIBLE food finally came out, and then the lights shut off for the show to start. I would say it is very difficult to eat in the dark but after a few bites I was done. The show started late so it went into the evening later then planned. I have heard Ralphie doesn't always stop when he is supposed to (which can be great) but it was time for us to get out of there. We asked our server for our check and he said he couldn't check us out in there that we had to step into the lobby area. It didn't make any sense but walked away without more explanation. I tried to explain to my sister what he said but she was just as confused as I. We went ahead and got up and went into the lobby, where there was not where for us to pay at all. The server finally came out and asked where we were going, I told him I said we needed our check so we could leave. He brought us the check, wrong, over $35 of the bill was not ours. I gave him my card and it took him forever but luckily got it fixed and as far as I know didn't charge me incorrect. By far this has been the worst experience I have had at the Tempe improv. May the remodle wasnt the best idea.....\n",

            "Original: It's never fair to judge a club by the comedians on a Wednesday night..... too bad, it would have earned a better rating because the actual show was great. Arrived with 4 friends and picked up our tickets, no issues. We were seated right up front and our original server quickly greeted us, brought us menus and told us about the special drinks for the evening; one of which was a mojito. One of my friends ordered the mojito and about 5 min later our server returned to tell us that they were out of mint. She was a good sport and just ordered something else but you would think that the servers would have been informed if one of the specials was unavailable. My white wine was served warm, gross. All of us ordered food. 2 of us got the Buffalo Chicken Sliders, one of us requested no blue cheese. After our food came I thought they had mistakenly brought both orders plain so I asked for a side of ranch. I later found a small drop of blue cheese on mine even though it wasn't enough to be noticed. Around this time, our original awesome server came over to tell us that he was cut for the night and introduce us to server 2 who quickly wanted to know what our second drink choice would be. One of my friends asked if food doesn't count as one of the items as she was the one driving.... No it doesn't which to me, it a horrible policy, especially if that policy is not made known. When the check came, I noticed that I had been charged $1.50 for ranch. I wouldn't have needed the ranch if my food was presented as it was advertised. The only thing we ordered that was actually good was the $8 side of sweet potato fries. I'm sure I'll be back because I enjoy comedy but next time, it will be 2 whatever-is-cheapest drinks and we'll go out to dinner elsewhere.\n",

Anyone  Anyone  Bueller  I had high hopes for the \"new and improved\" Tempe Improv.  I love love love stand-up comedy but always found it hard to justify what is bound to be a rather expensive evening.  Unfortunately, the new policies have made it that much harder.  They automatically add an 18% gratuity to EVERY CHECK.  Had our service not been terrible, I wouldn't have minded this nearly as much.  Our waitress was nice but it took absolutely forever to get anything.  We asked for water when we were seated (which was 45 minutes before the start time of the show) and didn't actually receive water until halfway through the show.  Long before this though, two in our party physically walked up to the bar and brought back waters for the table.  They've changed the \"two item minimum\" to a \"two drink minimum\" thus making the entire experience even rape-ier.  The menu looks very much the same as the old menu.  The food quality is, overall, poor.  My husband's quesadilla was TINY.  It looked like a child's plate.  My buffalo chicken salad was mostly lettuce and the chicken had possibly been hot the day before.  It had clearly been around a while.  It wasn't even warm and was tough to cut.  The pretzel appetizer was okay but I am spoiled for pretzels thanks to Claim Jumper and Arrogant Butcher.  These were slightly better than the Super Pretzels you bake at home. The drink situation is highway robbery, prison sex and food poisoning all at the same time.  My friend and I ordered standard cosmos.  They arrived and my glass was nowhere near full and it tasted like cherry koolaid.  They were so bad we asked to send them back and get something else.  The waitress accommodated us (which was nice) and the drinks sat on our table.  Upon reviewing the check, she did take off the cosmo but I noticed that it was $11 plus a $2 upgrade for SMIRNOFF.  Smirnoff.  Are you kidding  She even asked us if we wanted to upgrade vodka and we said no.  Smirnoff being an upgrade still boggles my mind.  What do you get without an upgrade  Harry's Toilet Vodka  We all tried each other's drinks and everything was weak and watered down.  The one thing they've done right is rearrange the club so there is less seating and you are not accidentally creating a child with your neighbor.  Admittedly, it was nice not to be so crammed in.  Despite these issues, we enjoyed the comic immensely (we saw Michael McDonald).  As I said earlier, I love stand-up but the current practices at the Improv are going to make it very difficult for me to come back.\n",

            "Original: I recently visited the Tempe Improv a couple of weeks ago to see Michael McDonald.  I was looking forward to seeing the changes made to the \"new\" Improv, but was incredibly disappointed, mostly with the service.I truly enjoy getting out to a comedy show.  There's nothing more entertaining than a night out with friends laughing.  Makes for an amazing time.  I absolutely loved Michael McDonald and his opening act.  The comedy that night was fantastic....but that was where it ended.  It started with our server, who didn't even bring us water until at least halfway through the show.  A friend and I had to go up to the bar ourselves in order to get water for our table of 6.  I understand that it's hectic with all the tables being sat practically at once, but an establishment like this should be prepared and expect that sort of thing.  It is NOT ok to keep your paying customers waiting extensive amounts of time for anything, especially water.  As part of your 2 drink requirement, I would HIGHLY recommend that you get either beer or wine.  You'll get the most for your money from either of those options.  Their mixed drinks are not even worth mentioning.  A friend and I ordered a cosmo.  How can you go wrong with a cosmo, right  Well....they successfully did.  It tasted like punch, and not even good punch, with absolutely NO alcohol.  I had asked our server how much the cosmo was, because there were no prices on the menu, and she had told me they were $11.   I was a little shocked to see a tiny martini glass not even full come out, knowing that I was going to have to pay $11 for this.  She had also asked if I wanted to upgrade, which I declined.  I noticed on the check that there was an extra $2 charge for an upgrade to Smirnoff.  1) How is Smirnoff an upgrade 2) I said I didn't want an upgrade and 3) The fact that you're charging that ridiculous amount for a drink that didn't taste good and had no trace of alcohol in it is absolutely absurd.  The only good thing our server did was allow us to trade our drinks and order something new.  I ordered a long island, which was ok, but nothing close to what a long island should taste like.  It was a whole lot better than the ridiculous attempt at a Cosmo though.  I realize that these sort of outings are already going to be overpriced, but I don't expect to get such poor service.  Out of my group of 6, there was really only 1 meal that was enjoyed, which were the nachos.  Everything else was maybe adequate at the best.  I don't expect gourmet food at the improve, but I expect edible and decent food, since I am paying the overly priced rates.  The final straw that threw me overboard was the fact that EACH check was automatically charged 18% gratuity.  I used to be a server, so I normally tip about 20% for good service.  We didn't receive anything close to good service, and to be forced to pay 18% in GRATUITY (which means it should be left up to me on how much I WANT to give), is ridiculous.  The good servers at this establishment are missing out on at extra 2% and the customers are being ripped off for being required to tip a bad server way too much.  My experience at the \"NEW\" Tempe Improv was definitely less than desirable.  Like I said before, the comedy was the only good factor.  It makes it hard to want to go back when there are so many other options in town.  I will definitely have to rethink my decision to return, and will do only for a comedian worthwhile.  If I do return, I will be eating dinner somewhere else and only be ordering the required 2 drink minimum.\n",

Can you say RIP OFF The tickets were reasonably priced ($20) but then there was a \"two drink minimum\" rule. I wasn't thirsty do I opted for the cheapest option- I ordered a lemonade, which was super nasty. So I sent it back and ordered a sprite instead- also very nasty. I don't know how they managed to make their simple fountain drinks taste so bad. Anyway, the next time I saw my waitress it was to bring me my check, which was $13!! I had only drank a couple sips of each of my drinks and that's what they charged. So stupid- that's almost the price that I paid for my ticket itself.

Let me start by saying that I work in customer service, so I know what good customer service looks like and what bad customer service looks like. Tonight we received AWFUL service from a server. We were under the impression that the 2 drink minimum requirement could include beer and soft drinks. Seeing as how we had already paid about $50 to see the show, and it is ridiculous to pay over $10 for one cocktail, we figured going the cheaper route would be the way to go. Once we ordered a coke and  Blue Moon, the server shut us down and gave us the most attitude I have ever received from a server. She didn't make eye contact with us, she told me the beers she had like it was some kind of chore and she had better places to be. She also passed us by several times, while we had empty drinks on the table, helped the customers around us, and pretended like we didn't exist. Yes, we ordered the cheapest drinks we could, but the gratuity was included and our bill STILL came out to $30 for only 3 beers and a soda. As outrageous as that is alone, I still can't believe the service we received. We were paying customers and deserved to be treated as such. What if I was in AA and ordered a soda because I couldn't drink alcohol That is unacceptable service and we will not be coming back to this establishment.\n",

They included one watered down drink each.  Yes, even my bottled water (that is clearly labeled $4) cost $10.50, plus a $2.50 upcharge, plus tax, plus whatever else it took to get to the $40.

Entertainer isn't the right word for this 4th class hack.People, please, listen to me.  I promise I will not steer you wrong.This is the worst performer I have ever had the displeasure of seeing.

To include a divorce, a motorcycle accident and a root canal.Three friends and I agonized over leaving in the middle of the show but in the end just had to.  His \"entertainment\" bordered on embarrassing!  Like an untalented William Hung, GB can't sing, can't dance, can't tell jokes.All of his impersonations sound like the same guy--HIM.  Try watching Gordie Brown do Michael Jackson.  It was painfully like Gordie Brown doing Gordie Brown.It's too bad, too.  He seems like a nice guy.

            "Original: Without a doubt, the absolute worst Vegas showcomedian I have ever witnessed!  Went to the show hearing that he is so fantastic like many of these reviews, but oh what a surprise. Seriously, not sure how he is employed...Within the first 3- 5minutes of the show, I wasn't sure if his crappy impressions were a real attempt at humor or a bad Andy Kauffman like impression put-on.  After 5 minutes it didn't get better and I was torn between being  embarrassed for him or completely ticked that I actually paid to see the performance.  His shiny white teeth contrasted nicely with his dark shirt with a hole in the armpit...nice touch Gordy. Not funny... best joke of the night was him jokingly tellingthanking the weekend audience (90% over 50) that it was his 3162 consecutive sellout to a clearly at best half empty room.  He blamed it on a fictitious foreign tour bus driver that must have mistakenly taken the rest of the crowd to the wrong hotel...the silver nugget instead of the golden nugget (rim-shot here). Oh God help me!I am being serious here when I write all this...I've heard better song impressions at the local karaoke bar and better joke telling in a 5th grade talent show... really!  Not joking.  As For being current... Jokes about Tatoo from fantasy island...really  The show has been off the air for 28 years and the actor who played \"tatoo\" has been dead for 19 years.  Jokes about Sammy Davis with 1 eye...I get it he sees with one eye not 2.  Sammy had a fake eye so he looks funny.  Then we get into impressions from the blockbuster film we all know and love on golden pond...oh wait that was 31 years ago.  When do we get to see Gordy do \"the Fonz\" AAAAAAEEEEE!I got up and left to take a leak during the set with hopes that he would try to embarrass me and ask where I was going.  Funny thing is I wanted him too as I was ready with the comment have you seen your show... the only thing worse than the act is the overdone photoshop work on his marquee out front.  Pretty scary when you are an introvert and want take on a seasoned comedian, but nothing about his act was witty, fun, or entertaining. I was with a big group, and so I did come back for more.Closest edgy part is when he did a crappy deep mexican accent (could have been the Frito Bandito as far as I could tell) claiming it was Antonio Banderes (of course he needed to tell you who he was doing in his accent first...and how relevant is Antonio these days anyway)  Mentioned Antonio did the animated movie puss and boots as it was his 2 favorite things boots and ... pause...(rimshot here).  Is that funny to you and am I missing somethingIf you are 65-100, maybe this thing is for you, but for me (45) this was a impressioncomedy suck fest at its finest. I wouldn't go again for free even if they served beer and washed my car in the parking garage...really.  Honestly Gordy, contact me and I'll be glad to get my refund!  You seem like a nice man but I left the show feeling like I lost an hour+ of my life and $100 over nothing more than a crappy PT Barnum sideshow.  A sucker is born every minute and I left feeling like one!  Person with me walked out and said they needed a drink to recover from the awful performance. We both left feeling 100% ripped off, not in a happy mood.My advice, look up his act online on youtube and if that works for you, enjoy, if not, be warned.  Best part of the night was the Golden Nugget casino that was surprisingly very nice inside for an old-town vegas casino.\n",

I went to the show with my sister, and we were probably the youngest ones there, except for the 21st birthday girl who got a b-day shout out in middle of the show. So from there on I knew we are going to hear bunch of corny and out dated jokes. He was impersonating a bunch of older singers and bands and all of sudden, Eminem comes out of no where. I was laughing, only because it was so ridiculous. And then George W Bush jokes start to surface throughout half of the show. I mean really Enough with the Bush jokes already. We get it, other comedians have all used the same punch lines and ridicules, lets just move on.In the end, I really wanted to leave early, but we were sitting in the front and I feel really bad walking out of the show. Gordie has a awesome and powerful voice. Very charismatic on the stage. But his jokes and impersonations are just dull and out of date. I cannot connect with the guy but I do see a lot of baby boomers where laughing their asses off. The show is not for me.\n",

Absolutely the corniest sense of humor I've ever had the misfortune of seeing on a stage. His impressions are often dated and usually inaccurate. If he hadn't announced some of them prior to performing them, I would have been at a loss for who he was mimicking. A half hour into the show, we were waiting for him to turn his back on the crowd for a moment so we could run out of the theater and put an end to our suffering. I do acknowledge that some people in the audience seemed to be enjoying themselves, but I have no idea who his audience is. Maybe people who thought \"Mama's Family\" was the funniest show ever. I've heard people compare him to Danny Gans, but as far as I'm concerned, there's no comparison. Gans was much more entertaining, his impressions were much more spot-on, and although I didn't find him the funniest guy in the world, he was Richard Pryor compared to Mr. Brown. I would certainly recommend a trip to Frank Caliendo's show if you're looking for an impressionist. If you find yourself at the Golden Nugget, go stare at their aquarium rather than watch this show...it's more entertaining and they have a pufferfish that does a better Nicholson than Brown does.\n",
